          Setting up Git and Github is a bit daunting, but you can do it.
        </p>
        <h2>First, the Easy Part</h2>
        <p>
          Getting started on GitHub is easy. All you need to do is 
          <a href="https://github.com/signup/free">register for a free GitHub account</a>.
        </h2>
        <h2>Git Setup: Trust the Professionals</h2>
        <p>
          GitHub maintains excellent, operating-system specific information for installing
          and configuring Git. <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git">You can find it here</a>;
          <b>stop following the instructions when you get to the "Password caching" section</b>.
        </p>
        <p class="alert alert-error">
          <b class="label label-important">Note</b> GitHub will offer Mac and Windows users the
          option to download a graphical user interface (GUI) for Git. Do not be tempted. Follow
          the instructions for installing the regular, command-line version of Git.
        </p>
        <h2>SSH Keys</h2>
        <p>
          To communicate with GitHub, you'll use SSH keys. Don't worry for now what those are.
          Just <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys">folow these
          instructions</a> to locate or generate your keys, and add them to your GitHub account.
