          One of the hardest things for Git newcomers is figuring out how Git
          fits with their workflow.
        </p>
        <p>
          Everyone knows that you have to save files on a computer. Whether its
          an image or a document, <code>File > Save</code> is a routine thing
          we do to save our work.
        </p>
        <p>
          Git adds a couple of extra steps to the process of saving work.
        </p>
        <p>
          The basic Git-powered workflow looks something like this:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Make some changes to your file
          </li>
          <li>
            Save your file
          </li>
          <li>
            Tell Git about the file or files you want to commit with
            <code>git add</code>
          </li>
          <li>
            Tell Git to preserve a snapshot of those files with
            <code>git commit</code>
          </li>
          <li>
            Make some more changes to your file...then add, the commit
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          In short, you <b>change</b> your file, you <b>save</b> the file,
          you <b>add</b> it to a list of files ready for preservation, and
          then you <b>commit</b> it to your repository.
          <b>Change. Save. Add. Commit.</b>
        </p>
        <p>Letâ€™s break that process down.</p>
        <h2>Changing &amp; Saving Files</h2>
        <p>
          Git works best with plain text formats (such as HTML or CSS files), but
          it can track changes to anything, including image files.
        </p>
        <p>
          Just as you normally would, you make changes to your files, and you save
          them when the work is good. <b>But if you get to a point where you have
          another idea or an alternative approach you want to try out, it's time to
          tell Git about your changes.</b>
        </p>
        <h2>Tell Git What to Commit</h2>
        <p>
          Sometimes a meaningful change that you want to commit is contained in a single
          file. If you're working on a Web page called <code>about.html</code>, and you
          revise a paragraph of copy, you just need to commit that one file:
        </p>
        <pre>$ git add about.html</pre>
        <p>
          Once you add the file, <code>git status</code> will tell you what files the
          commit will include:
        </p>
<pre>
$ git status
# On branch master
# Changes to be committed:
#   (use "git reset HEAD &lt;file&gt;..." to unstage)
#
#	modified:   index.html
#
</pre>
      <p>
        Sometimes, though, one change is spread over two different files. Imagine
        that you revised a class in HTML, like <code>&lt;h1 class=&quot;page_title&quot;&gt</code>,
        to a simpler <code>&lt;h1 class=&quot;title&quot;&gt</code>. You would also need to adjust
        your CSS selector from <code>h1.page_title</code> to <code>h1.title</code>.
      </p>
      <p>
        In that particular case, you edited two different files, but for a single change. Both
        files should be staged for a commit: <code>git add index.html css/styles.css</code>
      </p>
      <h2>Tell Git to Commit</h2>
      <p>
        Once you have checked via <code>$ git status</code> that the correct file(s) are staged
        for commit, it's time to make the commit. The shorthand version for this is
        <code>$ git commit -m "Commit message goes here"</code>:
      </p>
<pre>
$ git status
# On branch master
# Changes to be committed:
#   (use "git reset HEAD &lt;file&gt;..." to unstage)
#
#	modified:   index.html
# modified:   css/styles.css
#

$ git commit -m "Changed .page_title to simply .title"
[master 3df6a79] Changed .page_title to simply .title
 2 files changed, 2 insertions(+), 2 deletions(-)
</pre>
      <p>
        Note that in Git, a changed line will be reported as both an insertion, and a deletion.
        From a certain perspective, this is true: you "deleted" the old line, and "inserted" a
        new one (even if it was only part of the line that changed.
