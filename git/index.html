        <p>At first glance, Git seems overwhelming.</p>

        <p>It is. Or rather, it tends to be.</p>

        <p>
          But if you strip Git down to its essence, there are actually only a few things you do
          with any regularity.
        <p>
        <h2>Start Working</h2>
        <p>
          There are two ways to start working in Git: initialize a repository, or clone an existing
          one.
        </p>
        <h2>See What's Up</h2>
        <p>
          It's common practice to do the following three things to see what's going on in the
          repository and your work.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>What happened before: <code>git log</code> is ...</li>
          <li>What's happening now: <code>git status</code> is ...</li>
          <li>What's about to happen: <code>git diff</code> is ...</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Work, Work, Work</h2>
        <p>
          You do work, you add files to be committed (<code>git add</code>) and then you commit
          them (<code>git commit</code>).
        </p>
        <h2>Share with the World</h2>
        <p>
          You share your changes with the rest of the world by running <code>git push</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          You grab changes from the world by running <code>git pull</code>, after specifying
          who "the world" is by running <code>git remote add</code>.
