To get an idea of what JavaScript is, it's useful to think of some
of the things we can do with it.
<ul>
  <li>When Google tries to guess what you're typing in its search box
  and displays different possibilities, that's JavaScript.</li>
  <li>When you're signing up for a new account on a website, and it
  tells you in real time as you type your password if it's strong enough,
  that's JavaScript.</li>
  <li>When you you click on an item on a menu, and it expands
  to show you more options, that's JavaScript.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
What do these things have in common? They all have to do the
<em>behavior</em> of a webpage. JavaScript is a programming language
that is implemented in all modern web browsers that let us write
programs to allow for greater interactivity on a webpage. While
HTML lets you define the content of a page, and CSS lets you define
what that content looks like, JavaScript lets you define how it behaves
and how it should interact with whoever is looking at it.
</p>

<p>
Learning the basics of JavaScript will allow you to add this kind
of behavior to your web content. In addition to letting you make
more interesting webpages, JavaScript is a great programming language
to learn because of its ubiquity. As mentioned before, almost all
modern web browsers include a JavaScript interpreter, so knowing JavaScript
lets you write scripts that can run on almost any platform.
