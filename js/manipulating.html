        Here is a button:
        </p>

        <button type="button" class="btn" id="color-change-button">Change background color</button>

        <p>
        If you tried clicking on it, you'll notice that nothing
        happened. That's because it hasn't actually been programmed to do
        anything. But that's about to change! Fire up your browser's
        JavaScript console, and you're going to make that button do what
        it says.
        </p>

        <p>
        Type the following into the console:
        </p>

        <pre>
        <code>
          var btn = document.getElementById("color-change-button");

          btn.onclick = buttonClickHandler;

          function buttonClickHandler() {
            var randomColor = getRandomColor();
            document.body.style.background = randomColor;
          }
        </code>
        </pre>

        <p>
        Try clicking the button again. You should see a result.
        </p>

        <button type="button" class="btn" id="make-not-annoying-button">Change background color back</button>

        <p>
        I've gone ahead and added this button along with the
        JavaScript for you to change the background color back, in
        case your new random background color is unbearable.
        </p>

        <p>
        Go ahead and take a look at what you just typed in and see
        if you can make any sense of it. If not, that's okay. Before
        understanding what you just did, we need to learn a few more
        concepts about the JavaScript language and how it interacts with
        HTML, but we'll be returning to the code you just entered as
        an example. So, in trying to figure out how exactly that code works,
        the first thing we need to understand are objects.
        </p>

        <h2>Objects</h2>

        <p>
        Before when we talked about values, we really only talked about
        numbers (42) and strings ("Hello!"). There are other types of values,
        though, and one very important type is <em>objects</em>.
        </p>

        <p>
        An object in JavaScript is very similar to an object in real life.
        Take your car, for example. Your car is an object. What are some
        ways you can describe your car? You can say that its <strong>make</strong>
        is <em>Chrysler</em>. You can say that its <strong>model</strong> is
        <em>PT Cruiser</em>. You can say that its <strong>color</strong> is
        <em>red</em>. The way you say what your car is is by describing various
        aspects of it. In programming terms, your car is an <em>object</em>, and
        the things we just mentioned in bold are <em>properties</em>. That is to
        say, color is a property of car, and the value of that property is "red."
        Another way to phrase that is that an object is a named container
        for a set of values. Let's jump into the REPL to see if we can make more
        sense of this.
        </p>

        <p>
        Try typing this in your REPL: <br />
        <code>var car = {color: "red", make: "Chrysler", model: "PT Cruiser"}</code> <br />
        Alright, this looks weird. But remember just a couple sentences ago we
        said one way to think of an object is as a container for a set of values?
        Well, think of the curly brackets as that container. It is a named container
        because we're assigning this all to a variable with the name "car."
        Inside that container, we have a bunch of string values, like "red,"
        and "Chrysler," and those strings are assigned to the names "color"
        and "make," respectively.
        </p>

        <p>
        If you now type <code>car.color</code> in the REPL, it will print the
        string "red." There's something going on here. You are accessing the
        color <em>property</em> on the car <em>object</em>, so the REPL is returning
        to you the value of that property. Try it for the other properties
        on your car object. The lesson to learn here is that to access a value
        in an object, you reference it by <code>object.property-name</code>.
        </p>

        <p>
        I want to introduce another syntax -- or another way of writing --
        the stuff we just wrote. We could also do this:

        <pre>
        <code>
        var car = {};
        car.make = "Chrysler";
        car.model = "PT Cruiser";
        car.color = "red";
        </code>
        </pre>

        In this case, <code>{}</code> simply stands for an empty object.
        So first, we make car an empty object. Then, we use a similar syntax
        to the one we were using before to dynamically add those properties
        to it.
        </p>

        <p>
        At this point, you've seen a couple different ways to create a
        car object with several properties, and you've also seen how to
        access those properties. Let's add another property to our
        object now.

        <pre>
        <code>
        car.driver = {};
        car.driver.firstname = "Stephen"
        car.driver.lastname = "Malkmus"
        </code>
        </pre>

        What did we just do here? We created another property on car called
        driver. But what is the value of driver? <em>It is another object</em>.
        You are basically living out the movie <cite>Inception</cite> -- you
        are putting objects inside objects. Now try typing
        <code>car.driver.firstname</code>. As you might expect, you see the
        string value you assigned there. You can nest objects arbitrarily deep.
        Try to add another object to our driver property called "band." Then
        add a string property called "name" to that object with the value "Pavement."
        After doing this, you should be able to type <code>car.driver.band.name</code>
        and you'll see the result "Pavement."
        </p>

        <p>
        In practice, you probably wouldn't organize an object like
        this -- it would be silly to have to reference a car just to
        find out a band name. But this little exercise should give you
        some insight into one of the lines we saw in our example
        above. Remember this? <br />
        <code>document.body.style.background = randomColor;</code> <br />
        That should make more sense now. <code>document</code> is an object.
        It has a property called <code>body</code>. This has a property
        called <code>style</code>. That is also an object! Finally,
        we reach <code>background</code>. This is just a string property
        on <code>style</code>.
        </p>

        <p>
        We began this section by describing objects as a container for
        a set of name-value properties, such as <em>Make</em> and <em>Model</em>.
        There's one last thing we need to know about objects: in addition
        to containing properties, objects can also contain <em>functions</em>.
        Imagine our car object had a function called <code>getDriver</code> that
        returned a value of the driver object in the car. So to store the
        driver object in a variable, we could call:

        <br />
        <code>
          var driver = car.getDriver();
        </code>
        <br />

        This is semantically equivalent to the following:

        <br />
        <code>
          var driver = car.driver;
        </code>
        <br />

        so there wouldn't necessarily be a lot of utility in this function.
        </p>

        <p>
        But what if car had another property called <code>passengers</code> that
        was a list of all passengers in the car? How could you find a specific
        passenger? There might be different ways to go about this, but the most
        convenient would be if there was some sort of function like <code>getPassengerByName</code>
        that you could call like this:

        <br />
        <code>
          var kurt = car.getPassengerByName("Kurt");
        </code>
        <br />

        We'll revisit these ideas more in the next chapter, but the important
        thing to keep in mind is that objects as containers can also contain
        functions, and one use of those functions might be to provide
        an easy way to access different properties of the object.
        </p>

        <p>
        Be proud of yourself for making it through this section! Objects
        are unlike anything we have seen yet in JavaScript. The important
        thing to remember is that when you see something like
        <code>document.body.style.background</code>, all of those dots
        mean that you're traversing a series of objects in order to
        access a property. This has been a difficult section, but it's
        also been an important one. Objects are at the core of our next
        topic -- the Document Object Model, or the DOM.
