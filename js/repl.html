<h2>Learning Objectives</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Describe what a REPL is</li>
  <li>Access the REPL in your favorite browser</li>
</ul>

<p>
Below is a list of the common popular web browsers and instructions on how to
access what is called either their JavaScript console or JavaScript REPL.
You'll be using this both in the rest of this section as well as the rest
of the JavaScript chapter.
</p>

<h3>Google Chrome</h3>
<p>
To open up the JavaScript console on Windows and Linux in Chrome, press
Ctrl-Shift-J. In Mac OS, press Command-Option-J. You should see something
like this:
</p>

<h3>Firefox</h3>
<p>
To open the JavaScript console on Windows and Linux in Firefox, press
Ctrl-Shift-K. In Mac OS, press Command-Option-K. You should see something
like this:
</p>

<aside>
The default Firefox console should work fine for going through the JavaScript
lessons here, but a popular alternative to the default console is
<a href="http://getfirebug.com/">Firebug</a>, which is available as a Firefox
add-on that has a lot of other neat features.
</aside>

<h3>Internet Explorer</h3>
<p>
To open the JavaScript console in Internet Explorer, press the F12 button.
This will bring up the Internet Explorer Developer Tools. Once this is
open, click on the "Script" tab to access the JavaScript console. You should
see something like this:
</p>

<h3>Safari</h3>
<p>
To open the JavaScript console in Safari, first you have to enable it.
Open the Safari preferences and go to the "Advanced" tab. Then click the
"Show Develop menu in menu bar" checkbox.
</p>
<p>[TODO: insert figure here]</p>
<p>
Once the console is enabled, you can access it by pressing Command-Option-C.
You should see something like this:
</p>

<h2>What is a REPL?</h2>
<p>
Let's get some practice with these things inside of our JavaScript REPL.
I've been referring to this thing we've been looking for as a REPL, but
what does that mean? It stands for <strong>Read Eval Print Loop</strong>.
At first, this might look like jargon, but let's break it down.
</p>

<p>
When you type something into the REPL, first it <strong>reads</strong>
it. That just means it looks at what you typed in. Then it
<strong>evaluates</strong> it. We'll get into this in the next section,
but what this basically means is it applies some rules to what
you typed in. Finally, it <strong>prints</strong> the results.
<strong>Loop</strong> just means it never stops -- after it prints
out the result, it will be ready to read in the next thing you have
to say.
</p>

<h2>What's next?</h2>
You now know how to open up a JavaScipt console, and you have some idea of
what it does. You'll explore this more in the next section, where you learn
some fundamental programming principles, and use the REPL to help you along
the way.
