      <h2>Accessing the REPL</h2>
      <p>
      [This part will explain how to access the JavaScript console in a variety
      of different browsers.]
      </p>
      
      <p>
      See <a href="http://webmasters.stackexchange.com/questions/8525/how-to-open-the-javascript-console-in-different-browsers">StackExchange</a> for their list.
      </p>

      <h2>Values, Expressions, and Functions</h2>

      <p>
      We're going to talk more about working with the REPL soon, but
      before we do that, let's talk about what a <em>program</em> is.
      Afterall,  JavaScript is a <em>programming</em> language.
      </p>

      <p>
      For our purposes, let's say that a program consists of a set
      of <em>stuff</em>, and a list of instructions to perform on
      that <em>stuff</em> to produce new <em>stuff</em>. Admittedly,
      this is a bit a vague. But let's use a calculator as an example.
      </p>

      <p>
      When you type <code>2+3</code> into your calculator, that is
      a program. The <em>stuff</em> I was referring to before are
      the numbers 2 and 3. They are numbers -- one of the most basic
      things your calculator can understand. We are going to refer to
      these as <em>values</em>. In between these values, you type
      <code>+</code>. This is an instruction to the calculator. What
      you are saying is, "I want you to take these two numbers, and
      add them together." We'll refer to an instruction as a
      <em>function</em>. When you apply the addition <em>function</em>
      to the <em>values</em> 2 and 3, you get a result: 5.
      </p>

      <p>
      You could type something more complex into your calculator.
      For example, you could type: <br />
      <code> (10 * 5) / 25</code> <br />
      In this case, we have a couple of instructions we are giving
      the calculator: "First, multiply 10 by 5, and then divide the
      result by 25." To use the terms we just introduced, we want to
      apply the multiplication <em>function</em> to the <em>values</em>
      10 and 5. That will give us a result -- another value (50). Then
      we want to apply the division <em>function</em> to the <em>values</em>
      50 and 25. Our final result is 2. What's different in this example
      is that we have to apply one function before we can apply the other --
      we have to know what 10 * 5 is before we can divide it by 25. To
      introduce one more term, an <em>expression</em> is anything that
      produces a <em>value</em>. <code>(10 * 5)</code> is an <em>expression</em>
      because it produces the value 50. <code>(10 * 5) / 25</code> is
      an <em>expression</em> because it produces the value 2. An expression
      consists of some values and the functions you are applying to them.
      A program is just a big list of expressions.

      <p>
      Let's get some practice with these things inside of our JavaScript REPL.
      I've been referring to this thing we've been looking for as a REPL, but
      what does that mean? It stands for <strong>Read Eval Print Loop</strong>.
      At first, this might look like jargon, but let's break it down.
      </p>

      <p>
      When you type something into the REPL, first it <strong>reads</strong>
      it. That just means it looks at what you typed in. Then it
      <strong>evaluates</strong> it. We'll get into this in just a second,
      but what this basically means is it applies some rules to what
      you typed in. Finally, it <strong>prints</strong> the results.
      <strong>Loop</strong> just means it never stops -- after it prints
      out the result, it will be ready to read in the next thing you have
      to say.
      </p>

      <p>
      Open up your REPL and type in: <br />
      <code>42</code> <br />
      What happened? It should just print the number 42 right back at you.
      I said before that evaluation means applying some rules to what
      you typed in. 42 in JavaScript, like in our calculator example, is a
      value. The rule for values in the REPL is that they evaluate to themselves.
      </p>

      <p>
      Now type in: <br />
      <code>42 + 3</code> <br />
      What happened? It should print the number 45. Instead of typing in a
      <em>value</em>, you typed in an <em>epression</em>. The rule the
      REPL follows for expressions is to apply the functions in the expression
      to the values, resulting in a single value. If you type in
      <code>42 + 3 + 7 + 3</code>, it will apply the add function to all those
      values, and it will print the result 55.
      </p>

      <p>
      So far we've just been using the REPL as a calculator, giving it
      numeric values. But there are other types of values in JavaScript
      too. One of them is a <em>string</em>. Try typing this into the REPL: <br />
      <code>"Hello!"</code> <br />
      "Hello!" is a string value. You can tell it's a string because it is
      surrounded by quotation marks. We'll look more at using strings later.
      </p>

      <p>
      Now try typing: <br />
      <code>"Hello!".toUpperCase()</code> <br />
      What happened? It should print out "HELLO!" Why did it do that? What
      we just typed in was an expression. It looks different than <code>2+3</code>,
      but it actually has all the same elements. In this case, we have the
      string value <code>"Hello!"</code>. <code>.toUpperCase()</code> is
      actually a function that we are asking the REPL to apply to that
      value.
      </p>

      <p>
      Finally, try typing: <br />
      <code>alert("Hello!")</code> <br />
      What happened? You should have gotten a pop up window from your
      browser that said "Hello!" In this case, <code>alert</code> is
      a function, and we're giving it the value <code>"Hello!"</code>.
      But what does the REPL say? It should print out something like
      <code>undefined</code>. Up until now, we have been typing
      expressions into the REPL, and we have only looked at functions
      that produce values. Sometimes, we call functions that don't
      produce values, and instead we call them for their <em>side effects</em>.
      In this case, the side effect of calling <code>alert</code> is
      that the browser pops open a little window with our message,
      but the alert function does not produce a new value.
      </p>

      <p>
      TODO: Talk about variables here. It's going to be necessary, I think
      and this is probably the place to do it.
      </p>

      <p>
      You just learned a lot about some programming fundamentals. You
      have an idea about what <em>values</em>, <em>functions</em>,
      and <em>expressions</em> are, and seen some examples of them in JavaScript.
      You now know how to open up a JavaScript REPL in your browser, and
      have some experience experimenting with JavaScript inside of it.
      Next, you're going to use the REPL to add some functionality
      to this webpage, and in the process, learn more about JavaScript
      the language, and the role it plays on the web.
