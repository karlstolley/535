<h2>Learning Objectives</h2>

  <li>Use jQuery on your own web pages</li>
  <li>Explain what jQuery is and what you can do with it</li>
  <li>Use jQuery to manipulate the DOM</li>
</ul>

<h2>Getting jQuery</h2>
<p>
The easiest way to start using jQuery is to add the following line to your
web page.
<br /><br />
<code>
&lt;script src=&quot;https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.8.3/jquery.min.js&quot;&gt;
</code>
<br /><br />
This is the same thing we were doing in the last section where we were including
a library by using a script tag to point at a file. The difference is that in
this case instead of pointing at a local file, we are pointing at a JavaScript file
hosted at Google. You can also feel free to download your own copy of jQuery at
<a href="http:jquery.com">jquery.com</a>.
</p>

<h2>Using jQuery</h2>

<p>
The <a href="http://www.jquery.com">jQuery home page</a> describes jQuery as
a "fast and concise JavaScript Library that simplifies HTML document traversing."
At the end of the last chapter, we learned that a JavaScript library is just
a collection of code to make certain tasks easier. The task that jQuery makes
easier is traversing the DOM -- it allows you to more easily <em>query</em> the
DOM.
</p>

<aside>
jQuery actually has a lot of other functionality that has been added in in addition
to just manipulating the DOM, but we'll just be focusing on that aspect of the
library. To learn more, check out their <a href="http://jquery.com">official website</a>.
</aside>

<p>
The main function that jQuery offers you is <code>$</code>. That's just a dollar
sign. All of the functions we have seen so far have been named using letters, but
this one is just a symbol. You still use it the same way though. <code>$</code>
allows you to pass in a string to query for DOM elements. Let's look at an example.
</p>

<p>
Without jQuery, if we wanted to get the DOM element with the id, "myButton" we
would call:

<br />
<code>
  var element = document.getElementById("myButton");
</code>
<br />

Using jQuery, we would call:

<br />
<code>
  var element = $("#myButton");
</code>
<br />

As you can see, we can use a syntax similar to CSS selectors to query the DOM.
But why would we use jQuery here instead of our regular old DOM method
<code>getElementById</code>? There are a couple reasons.
</p>

<p>
First, <code>getElementById</code> returns a JavaScript object that we can manipulate
to do some cool stuff with, like attach events or manipulate styles. However,
<code>$</code> returns a sort of DOM super object that has a lot of other convenience
methods we can take advantage of. For example, the following code allows you to attach
an event to a div that makes it fade out when you click on it.

<pre>
<code>
$("#myDiv").click(function () {
  $("#myDiv").fadeOut("slow");
});
</code>
</pre>
</p>

<div id="myDiv">
  Here is a div with the id "myDiv." Paste the above code into
  your JavaScript console and give it a try.
</div>

<p>
That code takes advantage of the jQuery method <code>click</code> which
you can use to attach an event onto a jQuery element, and <code>fadeOut</code>
which you can call to animate an element to fade out. There are a ton of other
methods you can call on jQuery objects that allow you to animate them in other
ways and manipulate their properties.
</p>

<p>
The other reason you might want to use jQuery is that its selector syntax is
very powerful. In the above example, we were only selecting an element by
its id, which is pretty simple to do using vanilla JavaScript. But take a
look at this example:

<br />
<code>$("p:contains('JavaScript')").css("color", "red");</code>
<br />

This will select <em>every</em> paragraph element on the page that contains the word
"JavaScript" and will set its color property to "red." This illustrates
a couple of important points:
<ul>
<li>
  Unlike when we were searching by element id, jQuery allows us to select
  several elements on a page and apply some action to all of them. We can apply
  an action to every <code>ul</code> element, every element that has a certain class,
  every element that contains certain text, or many other scenarios.
</li>
<li>
  jQuery selectors let us do really cool stuff that would be hard if we were
  just using regular JavaScript DOM methods. In this example, we selected every
  div that contains certain text. You can also select elements that have a certain
  attribute, elements that are hidden or visible, as well as search for child elements
  within a certain parent element. For a full taste of what's possible, check out
  the <a href="http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors">jQuery selectors documentation</a>.
</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
These examples are fairly typical of what your jQuery calls will look like. You
call <code>$</code> with a selector to get a jQuery element, and you can then call
a method on that element. jQuery was also designed to allow you to chain multiple
calls together. So, for example, say you had the following HTML:

<pre>
<code>
&lt;ul id=&quot;bands&quot;&gt;
  &lt;li class=&quot;firstElement&quot;&gt;Pavement&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Silver Jews&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Jicks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
</code>
</pre>

If you wanted to remove the <code>firstElement</code> class from the
first element in the list, change its class to <code>specialFirstElement</code>
and then you wanted to change its color to red, you could do the following:

<br />
<code>
  $("#bands").find(".firstElement").removeClass("firstElement").addClass("specialFirstElement").css("color", "red");
</code>
<br />

As you can see, we can <em>chain</em> the various methods together. You should
be careful to not go overboard with this. Sometimes, like in this example when we
are removing one class and adding another, it makes sense to chain these methods
because it's clear that we are switching the class of this element. But if you
are doing a lot of manipulations to an element, you should also try to make sure
you maintain the readability of your code, and that might mean breaking things up.
