<p>
In <a href="/css/project.html">the CSS section</a>, you created two themes for
your GitHub profile page. Your assignment now is to write the JavaScript that
powers the button that allows you to switch between themes. Your CSS should be
designed such that all you need to do to to switch themes is find all elements
with a certain class, remove that class, and add a new one. You saw an example
very similar to this in the jQuery chapter.

<p>
Hint: Remember that jQuery selectors make it very easy for you to select all
elements on a page that meet certain criteria and then apply some transformation
to them.
