<h2>A history of JavaScript</h2>

<p>
You don't need to know a whole lot about the history of JavaScript,
but it's useful to learn a few things just to be familiar with some
of the terms you might encounter as you read more about it.
</p>

<p>
JavaScript was invented by a guy named Brendan Eich for Netscape
back in the 1990's. Netscape was the maker of a web browser, so at
that time, they made a competitor product to Microsoft's Internet
Explorer. It was originally called <em>Mocha</em> and <em>LiveScript</em>,
and the name JavaScript was finally chosen mostly for marketing reasons,
since the Java programming language was becoming popular at that time.
</p>

<p>
Microsoft wanted to be able to support similar functionality in Internet
Explorer, so they added a language called <em>JScript</em> to their
browser. JScript was similar to JavaScript, but not necessarily completely
compatible. By the mid 90's, it was clear that having a scripting language
in the browser was important, but that it would be too much of a hassle
to have to support different implementations in different browsers. So
a standard was written for the language. The standards body resposnible
for this standard is called ECMA, so the standard for the language is
called ECMAScript.
</p>

<p>
So, what can we learn from this history?
<ul>
  <li>JavaScript has almost nothing to do with Java, besides sharing a name.
  So if you don't know Java, don't think you're behind in learning JavaScript.
  If you do know Java, you might be a little more comfortable reading some JavaScript,
  but you shouldn't assume things work the same -- these are two different languages.</li>
  <li>There is a standard for JavaScript, but each browser still has their own
  JavaScript engine that implements that standard. Mozilla's JavaScript engine is
  called SpiderMoney. Google's JavaScript engine is called V8. This shouldn't matter
  for this tutorial, but if you run into these names when you are reading about JavaScript,
  they just refer to different browsers.</li>
  <li>Although there is a standard, certain browsers might not follow the standard
  completely. Everything we'll do in this tutorial should work in all modern web
  browsers, and for the most part, most JavaScript scripts that follow the standard
  should also work. But it is worth keeping in mind that there are still differences
  between browsers, so as you read more about JavaScript on the web, you might notice
  some people being annoyed with with these differences.</li>
  <li>ECMAScript refers to the standard, and JavaScript refers to browsers'
  implementation of that standard. The latest edition of ECMAScript is 5.1,
  and most modern web browsers will support that standard. We won't be doing
  anything too fancy that was introduced in the newest version, but it's important
  to know that if you're interested in the direction that JavaScript is heading,
  you should see what proposals are being made for the next version of ECMAScript.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>What's next?</h2>
<p>
Now that you have an idea of what you can do with JavaScript and
know a little bit about it's history, we're ready to dive in. In
the next section, we'll figure out how to access your web browser's
JavaScript console. That will let us learn more about JavaScript
in an interactive environment. You'll type in some commands to
the console to add some interactive features to this web page,
and in the sections that follow we'll examine more in depth
what those things were that you typed in, and in the process
learn more about JavaScript the language and how it relates to
something called the DOM. Finally, after getting an idea
on some of the language features of JavaScript and how to do
DOM scripting, we'll take a look at jQuery, a popular JavaScript
framework that simplifies common tasks in JavaScript.
