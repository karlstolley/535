<p class="lead">If you have completed the JavaScript chapter, you should now be familiar with the following topics:</p>

<h2>Using Your REPL</h2>

<p>A JavaScript console is a built in REPL environment in web browsers that let you
evaluate your scripts in real time.</p>
<p>Return to the <a href="repl.html">REPL</a> section.</p>

<h2>Basic Programming Concepts</h2>
<p>Values, functions, expressions, and variables are the basic building blocks
we can use to build programs.</p>
<p>Return to the <a href="programming.html">Programming Concepts</a> section.</p>

<h2>Objects</h2>
<p>Objects allow us to create key-value pair data structures along with
functions that operate on that data.</p>
<p>Return to the <a href="objects.html">Objects</a> section.</p>

<h2>The DOM</h2>
<p>Learning objects let us learn about the Document Object Model and how we
can use JavaScript to manipulate it on our web pages.</p>
<p>Return to the <a href="dom.html">DOM</a> section.</p>


<h2>Script Tags and Script Files</h2>
<p>Putting our JavaScript programs in separate files and including them
on our web pages with script tags allows us to maintain separation
of concerns as well as allow for reuse of our scripts.</p>
<p>Return to the <a href="scriptfiles.html">Script Tags and Script Files</a> section.</p>

<h2>jQuery</h2>
<p>jQuery is a JavaScript library that provides us with functions that make
it easy to write scripts to manipulate the DOM.</p>
