        Why did we have to learn all of that nested object stuff? Well,
        the next thing we are going to learn about is the
        <em>Document Object Model</em>. Notice that second word? Understanding
        objects is going to make this next part go a lot more smoothly.
        </p>

        <p>
        In the last section, we created a series of nested objects.
        We created a car object. Inside of that object was a driver
        object. A car might also have a passenger object. We can visualize
        this object hierarchy like this:
        </p>

        <p>
        [TODO: Insert Figure here.]
        </p>

        <p>
        When we graph out this object hierarchy, we get a graph that we
        call a <em>tree</em>. We call each object in the tree a <em>node</em>,
        and we can describe different relationships between nodes. At the
        <em>root</em> of our tree is the car object. The driver object
        is a <em>child</em> of car, because it is directly below it
        in the object hierarchy. We can also describe car then as driver's
        <em>parent</em>. What we're establishing here is a <em>model</em> --
        we are creating a way to describe the relationships between different
        the car object and its various properties. You might say we are
        establishing a <em>Car Object Model</em>.
        </p>

        <p>
        When we use JavaScript in an HTML document to manipulate that document,
        we use the <em>Document Object Model</em>. When your web browser loads
        an HTML page, it constructs a model for that page very similar to the
        model we just made up. For example, say you have a simple HTML that
        looks like this:

        <br />
        <pre>
        <code>
        TODO: Put example here.
        </code>
        </pre>
        <br />

        Like with our car object, we can imagine this HTML document as a set
        of object nodes:
        <br /><br />
        TODO: Put figure here
        <br /><br />
        </p>

        <p>
        The Document Object Model, or DOM, is very similar to the object model
        we came up with earlier, except the object nodes correspond to HTML
        elements. At the root of our model we have the <em>document</em> node.
        The descendents of the document node are the various HTML elements
        in the document in the same hierarchical structure as they appear in the
        HTML file.
        </p>

        <p>
        In the last chapter we discussed how it might be convenient to have
        functions on objects that help us find different child objects, for
        example, <code>car.getPassengerByName("Kurt")</code>. Luckily, JavaScript's
        DOM API gives us several ways to traverse the document nodes. A couple
        examples are <code>getElementById</code> and <code>getElementsByTagName</code>.
        </p>

        <p>
        At this point, we should be able to analyze the code you used to make
        the button change the background color. Let's take another look at it
        and break it down.
        </p>

        <pre>
        <code>
          var btn = document.getElementById("color-change-button");

          btn.onclick = buttonClickHandler;

          function buttonClickHandler() {
            var randomColor = getRandomColor();
            document.body.style.background = randomColor;
          }
        </code>
        </pre>

        <p>
        Our first line here is

        <br />
        <code>var btn = document.getElementById("color-change-button");</code>
        <br />

        We're calling <code>getElementById</code> on the document object. This
        traverses the DOM and finds an element with the ID <code>color-change-button</code>.
        We then store that object in a variable called <code>button</code>.
        </p>

        <p>
        Our next line is

        <br />
        <code>btn.onclick = buttonClickHandler;</code>
        <br />

        Remember that <code>btn</code> is a variable that contains an object that
        represents an HTML button. One of the properties on button objects is
        <code>onclick</code>. The value we assign to this property is a function
        that will fire when someone clicks the button. Here we just give it the
        name of a function, which we define in the following lines.
        </p>

        <aside>
        Other examples of properties on button you can assign functions to are
        <code>onmouseover</code> and <code>ondblclick</code>.
        </aside>

        <p>
        Let's examine the buttonClickHandler function

        <pre>
        <code>
        function buttonClickHandler() {
          var randomColor = getRandomColor();
          document.body.style.background = randomColor;
        }
        </code>
        </pre>
        </p>

        <p>
        The <code>getRandomColor</code> function is just a convenience function
        that returns a random color (note: this is not a standard JavaScript function,
        but rather one that was written for the purpose of this exercise.) In
        the first line of the function, we are just calling that and storing the value
        it returns in a variable called randomColor.
        </p>

        <p>
        The next line is where it gets interesting. So far we've looked at how
        we can use the DOM to retrieve a certain element. In the case of a button,
        we then assigned a function value to a property on that object. In this
        case, we're first accessing the <code>body</code> property on document.
        This just refers to the DOM object for the body element in our HTML document.
        Then, we access the <code>style</code> property on the body object.
        The style property is an object whose properties allow us to manipulate
        the styling of an HTML element. So when we set the <code>background</code>
        property to our randomColor variable, it changes the background color
        of the body element to that value.
        </p>

        <h1>Another Exercise</h1>

        <p>
        <div id="change-my-background-color">
          Please change my background color!
        </div>
        </p>

        <p>
        The text above is inside a div with the id <code>change-my-background-color</code>.
        Using your JavaScript console, try to enter code that will change the
        background color of the div when you move your mouse over it. Hint: The
        div DOM element has an <code>onmouseover</code> event you can assign a function
        to, similar to what we did before with the button.
        </p>

        <p>
        Remember that what you'll want to do first is get the DOM element that
        represents that div element, and you'll probably want to store it
        in a variable. Once it's in a variable, you can assign a function to
        its <code>onmouseover</code> property that uses the style property
        to change the background color of the div.
        If you get stuck, click the button below to see a solution, but try
        to work at it on your own first.
        </p>

        <button type="button" class=btn" id="show-solution">Show solution</button>

        <div id="solution">
        <pre>
        <code>
        var myDiv = document.getElementById("change-my-background-color")
        myDiv.onmouseover = mouseOverEventHandler;
        function mouseOverEventHandler() {
          myDiv.style.background = "red";
        }
        </code>
        </pre>

        </div>

        <p>
        Extra credit: You now know  that <code>onmouseover</code> is an event that
        fires when you move your mouse over an element. <code>onmouseout</code> is
        an event that fires when your mouse was on an element and then you move it
        off. Knowing about these two events, can you think of how you would write
        code that would change the background color of the div when you move your
        mouse over the div, and then change it back when you move your mouse off?
