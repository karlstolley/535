 <h2>What We've Learned</h2>

    	<p class="lead">So let's see if we can put together everything we've learned about HTML5. </p>
    	<p> We've learned that building a webpage involves many small components that work together to create a substantial infrastructure.<p>
    	<p> Your final project should look something like this, but with personalized to you, of course.</p>
    	<img src="images/sampleproject.png" alt="sample project">
    	
    	<p>How did your profile page turn out?</p>
    	
    	<h3>More Practice</h3>
    <p>	Ok, so how do you know if you really understand HTML5? Try moving some of the elements around to rearrange the infrastructure of the webpage. As we've learned, some of the elements cannot and should not be moved around (e.g. head, body, main navigation, etc.); but others elements are meant to be flexible so you can build a page to suit your needs. If you are unsure about why some elements can move and others cannot, review the sections on <a href="structure.html">structure</a>. </p>
    	
    	<ul>
    	<li>What can elements could you move around to present your content in the best way?</li>
    	<li> Would the image look better at the top of the page? </li>
    	<lil>How the table? Where should the table be place on the page </li>
    	<li>Should the unordered list be an ordered list?</li>
    	</ul>	
      
      <h3> Have We Met Our Learning Objectives?</h3>
<p>Have we met the learning objectives we set forth at the beginning of this chapter?</p>
<ul >
        	<li>Do you know how to create a basic web page?</li>
        	<li>Are you familiar with with HTML5 tags, attributes, and elements?</li>
        	<li>Do you understand what each of the following â€œtags" does and how to use them?</li>
        		<ul class="three-col">
        			<li> &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</li>
        			<li> &lt;html&gt; </li>
        			<li> &lt;head&gt;  </li>
        			<li> &lt;title&gt; </li>
        			<li> &lt;meta&gt; </li>
        			<li> &lt;link&gt; </li>

        			<li> &lt;footer&gt; </li>
        			<li> &lt;a&gt; </li>
        			<li> &lt;img&gt; </li>
        			<li> &lt;table&gt; </li>
        			<li> &lt;p&gt; </li>
        			<li> &lt;nav&gt; </li>
        			<li> &lt;ol&gt; </li>
        			<li> &lt;ul&gt;</li>
        			<li> &lt;li&gt; </li>
        			<li> &lt;row&gt; </li>
        		</ul>
