     <p> Here, you will learn about... So, let's take a look at what you will be working on.</p>
You will also see the html that went into creating this page, (i.e. The page you are reading now).  As if that weren’t enough, we’re also going to check out a few of the accompanying pages, to provide other examples.
Here’s what you will learn how to create. </p>
Simple page created with the following elements. 
<p>SAMPLE </p>
<p class"prettyprint"> Click here. </p>
<p>Ok. So what if we took out all of the text. Meaning all of the content. All we would be left with is code. </p>
CODE
So what if we took out all of the code.  What would we get?  Let's take a look at it now.
TEXT
Description of elements and tags here.

In a nutshell, this is what HTML does. Without the HTML, it's just a block of text. No formatting. No spacing. Just text. With HTML (and the help of the browser), the text is transformed into readable content that is displayed in a way we've come to recognize as a webpage.
Let's take a look at the code again, and see how it transformed text into content.

<h3 class "prettyprint"> &lt;Doctype HTML&gt; </h3>

The first element. First we see &lt;doctype HTML&gt;. 
This is essentially what makes a webpage a webpage. It’s what the browser reads to let it know that it should render the code. If you were to take a look at the [show how] HTML of various webpages, such as ..., and ..., this would be the very first thing you see. Go on, try it. There are variations of this based on the version of HTML the developer used when they built the page (but since we're learning the latest and greatest, we'll not go into that).
And, of course, without the doc tag, (as we’ll see below) it doesn’t read as a webpage, only as a bunch of text.

But that’s not it.  Remember when we talked about bookends? [introduce this here or before?] Let’s go all the way to the end of the sample code.  At the very end of the document we see &lt;/html&gt;.  This tag lets the browser know that the page is complete and there is nothing else to render. (it's possible)  Besides, it has enough to do with all of the juicy code we put between the brackets. So you’re probably wondering what would happen if we were to leave the end tag off. Well, that depends. Which browser are. Is this something you're really willing to risk? That would be the &lt;doctype html&gt; and the &lt;/html&gt;. Now lets get into the components of these tags. Pay attention here. This is basically what makes up html and we’ll see these over and over again. 
Like we just learned &lt;Doctype html&gt; is basically the tag that tells the browser that it is a webpage. And &lt;html&gt; is the tag that tells the browser to end it.
A tag is a command that tells the browser what to do. A browser recognizes an html tag by the angle brackets &lt; and &gt;. Just like the bookends in the tags you need to open with the &lt; and close with the &gt;. 
Just like books held upright on a shelf by two bookends, taking one off, will cause everything to come crashing down, or at least until its meets the next &gt;. 
In HTML (and SGML and XML), the less-than sign is used at the beginning of tags. The less-than sign may be included with &lt;. For end tags, the closing part of the bookend, 
Let’s put some of the text back in and see what we get.</p>
