<h2> The Head</h2>
<p class="lead">
Webpages consist of two major elements: the <strong>head</strong> and the <strong>body</strong>. We'll deal with the <strong>head</strong> now then go on to learning more about the <strong>body</strong>. </p>
 

<pre class="prettyprint">
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html lang="en"&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt;
 &lt;title&gt;HTML5 Sample&lt;/title&gt;

  &lt;!--Brief page description:--&gt;
  &lt;meta name="description" content=""&gt;
  &lt;!--Name(s) of primary authors--&gt;
 &lt;meta name="author" content=""&gt;

  &lt;!--Styles--&gt;
&lt;!-- &lt;link href="/assets/css/bootstrap.css" rel="stylesheet"&gt; --&gt;

&lt;/head&gt;
</pre>


     <h3>Head</h3>
<p> As you can see in the project HTML, immediately after the <code class="htmlcode">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</code> and the opening <code class="htmlcode">&lt;html&gt;</code> tag, is the the <code class="htmlcode">&lt;head&gt;</code> start tag. About ten or so lines down you will find the <code class="htmlcode">&lt;head&gt;</code> end tag. The section enclosed in these tags is called the <strong>head</strong> of the document and contains important information for the web designer and the browser to know but does not necessarily get displayed for the public. Here, you include <strong>meta</strong> information (see below) as well as links to stylesheets and scripts (though scripts could be placed below the body as well). There is no particular order in which the elements should be presented; however, the only information that is necessary to include in the <strong>head</strong> is the title. </p>
<aside> For more information about stylesheet and scripts see the chapters on <a href="/css/index.html">CSS</a> and <a href="js/index.html">Javascript</a>.</aside>
     
     <h3>Tags and Elements Within the Head</h3>
     
     <h4>Title</h4>
<p>The title tags <code class="htmlcode">&lt;title&gt;</code> and <code class="htmlcode">&lt;/title&gt;</code> let the browser know what the name or title of document is. Depending on your browser, the title is typically displayed at the in the title bar of browser window, or if you are using browser tabs, in the tab. It helps orient the user to the name of the page. It also appears as the name of the document in the user's favorites listing if the user chooses to bookmark the page.</p>
     <h4>Base</h4>
<p>The base element identifies the base URL of the document, that is, its the main website URL, in order to make it easier to use relative webpages for hyperlinks. As we will see more of when we go to the link section of this chapter.</p>
     <h4>Link</h4>
<p>The <code class="htmlcode">&lt;link&gt;</code> and <code class="htmlcode">&lt;/link&gt;</code> tags are used to link to external resources that affect the behavior or look of the webpage. One common external resource is the CSS stylesheet. An attribute is needed to let the browser know what type of link it is. For stylesheets, the name is ref and the value is "stylesheet". For each additional stylesheet, a new link element is needed. We need to use the <code class="htmlcode">href</code> attribute to identify where the stylesheet is housed. The value of the attribute will be the destination. Depending on the type of link, the attribute is handled in different ways, as we will more about in <a href="image.html">Links and Images</a>.</p>
     <h4>Script</h4>
<p> Like the link tags, the script tags <code class="htmlcode">&lt;script&gt;</code>and <code class="htmlcode">&lt;/script&gt;</code> are used to define the external resources that affect the behavior of the webpage. However, unlike stylesheets which affect the look of the page, the external resources defined by the script tags are scripts which affect client-side interaction scripts, usually Javascript or Jquery.</p>
<p>For the script tags, the <strong>src</strong> attribute is used to identify the external sources.</p>
     <h4>Meta</h4>
<p>Meta information is any extra information about the particular webpage that describes the document or provides helpful explanations for future reference. Meta information is enclosed in the <code class="htmlcode">&lt;meta&gt;</code> and <code class="htmlcode">&lt;/meta&gt;</code> tags. Let's take a look at the meta information for our project. </p>


<pre class="prettyprint">
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html lang="en"&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt;
 &lt;title&gt;HTML5 Sample&lt;/title&gt;

  &lt;!--Brief page description:--&gt;
  &lt;meta name="description" content=""&gt;
  &lt;!--Name(s) of primary authors--&gt;
 &lt;meta name="author" content=""&gt;

  &lt;!--Styles--&gt;
&lt;!-- &lt;link href="/assets/css/bootstrap.css" rel="stylesheet"&gt; --&gt;

&lt;/head&gt;
</pre>


<p>Here, we've included meta information options for <strong>name</strong> and for <strong>author</strong>. Other meta information we can include would be search tags for browsers using the name <strong>keyword</strong> and the search words would be in the value content. It helps search engines find information faster about the page and helps you relate topics that may not be mentioned explicitly in the body of your page.</p>
     <h3>Comments</h3>
<p>So what if there is information you want to include for yourself or another developer, and not for the browser? That where comments come in. Comments are extremely useful to the content creator because it helps with reminders about certain code especially when a significant a amount of time lapses in between uses. In our sample project above, we've used comments to let us know how we are defining certain types of meta information. We would also include it to help distinguish types of styles and scripts from one another. To create a comment in html, simple add a <strong>&lt;</strong>, an exclamation point <strong>!</strong> and two dashes <strong>--</strong> to form a <code class="htmlcode">&lt;!--</code>. Place your comment, then enclose it with two dashes <strong>--</strong> and a <strong>&gt;</strong>.  Like all elements in html,comments must be enclosed; in this case, with a start <code class="htmlcode">&lt;!--</code> and ending <code class="htmlcode">--&gt;.</code></p>
<p>Comments are not confined to the head of an html document; they can also be used in the body.</p>

   <h3>Your Turn</h3>
   <p>Now that you have all of the elements you need to create the head of a webpage, what will you include in yours?</p>
   <ul>
   <li>What should the title of your personal profile be?</li>
   <li>What meta information would you like to include?</li>
   <li>Are there any comments or notes you would like to make for yourself or others to help you remember something important (or not so important)?</li>
   </ul>
   
   <h5> Let's move on to the body of the webpage, starting with <a href="structure.html">Structure</a>. </h5>
