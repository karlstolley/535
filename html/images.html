<h2>Links and Images</h2>

Links, also called hyperlinks, allow you to connect to other parts of a website and external websites. Images provide illustrative imagery to your content.

     
<h3>Links</h3>
<p> Now, let's learn about what makes a webpage truly a webpage&#8212;links. If not for links, a webpage would be a static document isolated from the rest of the internet, nearly impossible to reach and just as impossible to leave. Links are what makes the world wide web, the world wide <em>web</em>. </p>

<p>Here, we will learn about the two types of links: internal links and external links. But before we learn more about what makes each of these types of links unique, let's take a closer look at the link tag and its individual components.</p>

<p>Links are formed with the start tag <code> &lt;a&gt;</code> and end tag <code> &lt;/a&gt;</code>. 

<p>The origin anchor, also known as the source anchor, is where the link begins and is identified by the presence of the opening <code> &lt;a&gt;</code> tag. The target anchor is identified within the opening tag with the <strong>href</strong> attribute. The <strong>value</strong> of the attribute will be the link destination. Depending on the type of link&#8212;local page or external&#8212;the attribute is handled in different ways, as we will soon see below. </p>

<aside>For a refresher on attributes, visit the <a href="elements.html"> Tags, Attributes, and Elements</a> section of this tutorial.</aside> 

<p>Basically, the element structure for links is <code> &lt;a href="LINK DESTINATION"&gt; WHAT VIEWER SEES AS A HYPERLINK&lt;/a&gt;</code>.</p>

<aside> Be sure not to confuse the <code> &lt;a&gt;</code> tag with the <code> &lt;link&gt;</code> tag; <code> &lt;a&gt;</code> tags only appear in the body, and <code> &lt;link&gt;</code> tags only appear in the head of the document</aside>


<h4>External Links</h4>
<p>We'll start with the simplest types of links&#8212;the external link. </p>

<p>To insert a link in your content to an external page is use the <code> &lt;a&gt;</code> <code> and &lt;/a&gt;</code>tags and insert the complete web address as the destination value. For example, if we wanted to provide a link from this page to the IIT home page, we would simple type <code> &lt;a href="www.iit.edu"&gt; IIT &lt;/a&gt;</code>, which appears to the viewer as <a href="www.iit.edu"> IIT</a>.</p>

<h4>Internal Links</h4>

<p>Internal page links connect to other webpages within the same website. For example, the various sections of this tutorial are housed on different pages within the same website- DigitalContentCreatorsResource.com. In order to create links to internal pages, you must know where the content for your pages resides. For example, the pages for this HTML5 tutorial are housed together in the same folder. If I wanted to link to another page within this tutorial, let's say the Overview, then I would list the name of the html document as the destination value in the attribute. Let's see the this in action: <code> &lt;a href="overview.html"&gt; Overview &lt;/a&gt;</code>.  As we can see, the anchor tag &lt;a&gt; contains the value as the name of the document. The viewer would only see <a href="overview.html"> Overview</a>.</p>


<h3>Images</h3>

<p> Images are part of the same tutorial as the links because they share the same concept only with different tags. The opening <code> &lt;img&gt;</code>tag contains the <strong>src</strong> attribute whose value identifies the image that should appear. Here, is where the idea closely follows the way an internal link is made. The value of the <strong>src</strong> attribute is usually within the same website that the webpage you are creating is in, usually within a folder named <strong>Images</strong>. Let's take a look below at a portion of our sample project for an example. </p>
   
   <pre class="prettyprint">
    &lt;h2&gt;My Future&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;img src="images/oceanview.jpg" alt="my future image"&gt;
    </pre>
<p>As we can see above, the <code> &lt;img&gt;</code> tag is used to indicated that an image is being inserted into the document. The value of the <strong>src</strong> attribute is the location of the image, which is in the <strong>Images</strong> folder.</p>
<p>Also above, we can see another attribute, the <strong>alt</strong>. The value for the <strong>alt</strong> attribute is the alternate text that would appear if for some reason the image did not load.</p>
<p>Remember, when we learned that there were several tags that did not require end tags. The <code> &lt;img&gt;</code> tag is one of them.</p>
    
    <h2>Your Turn</h2>
   <p>Where would you like to link your profile to? Parts of the same page, external pages?</p>
   <ul>
   <li>What images would you like to include in your profile? </li>
   
   </ul>
