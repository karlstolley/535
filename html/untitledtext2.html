      <p>The World Wide Web, aka, WWW (yes, that’s what that means) has undergone many changes since it’s inception a few decades ago.  If you were indoctrinated into the web with HTML or XHTML, have no fear, your knowledge will not be considered obsolete.  If you have only heard rumors of such a thing called HTML, don’t worry, we’ll walk you through the basics. </p>
<p>I can already hear you asking: What happened to 1, 2, 3, and 4?  As with any technological device, numbers are used to distinguish between different it iterations.
So, does that mean if I use say html 4, it wouldn’t work? Weeeelll, technically yes. Which is why we still remnants of the nineties and it’s, shall we say, distinctly antiquated webpages emerge from the dark every now and then. If it didn’t work, then we couldn’t see it. Which brings us to the next point? How is that possible? It’s all made possible with this little thing we call browsers (yes, I know, web browsers). Some people never consider the how the information  except by the question of whether or not they are connected (hello internet bills)  get to them, only that they do. All web browsers are free, so there is no cost to them except in their experience. Most people don’t even bother or know they could use other browsers except for the ones that come with the software (Internet Explorer/Safari). </p>
<p>If you look at the HTML for pages that were created 15 years, 15 months, or even 15 days ago, you will find a wide range of coding specifications running the gamut. (SIDEBAR: to view code of this page, select this) Yet it all works. A related question is why can’t you see the code when you go to a page? The browser you are using renders/translates the code into an attractive (hopefully) combination of images and text. In short, code only works if the browser can understand it. That’s because the code is only as powerful as the browser The HTML tells the browser what to display. How this is displayed (how attractive) is determined by another type of code. Yes, there’s more. So much more. (For more on how to make the what attractive, go on to the CSS section, after this one of course).  This is all related I promise. Basically, HTML5 is interesting than previous versions.</p>
