<h2>Body: Structure Part I</h2>

<p class="lead">Now it's time to learn about building content through a strong structure, the heart of a webpage.</p>
         
<h3>Body</h3>
    		<p> The body of the webpage houses all of the content that is intended to be displayed to the public. The browser renders everything enclosed within the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;/body&gt;</code> tags so that it is viewable. All tags that we learn from this point forward are housed within the body. </p>

<h3>Tags Used Within the Body</h3>
    	
    	<h4>Div</h4>
<p>The element formed by the <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>and <code>&lt;/div&gt;</code> tags is a generic container that is used when none of the other tags appropriately define the information contained. They are used most often with CSS.</p>

<h4>Section</h4>
    		<p>The <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> <code  >&lt;/section&gt;</code>tags are used to group like content together. Sections could be nested or stand alone. Usually, sections contain <a href="structuretwo.html">headers and footers</a>. </p>
       	 
<h4>Article</h4>
<p> The <code>&lt;article&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;/article&gt;</code> tags is used for grouped information within sections. These are usually not nested unless they are nested within sections of other sections.</p>
			
   	 	
<h4>Navigation</h4>
   			<p> The <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code>and <code>&lt;/nav&gt;</code> tags group navigation links together. These links are usually presented as an unordered list. We will discuss lists in more detail in part two of this next section, but for now it is important to know that all navigation should be distinguished from other parts of the page with the <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;/nav&gt;</code> tags. 
   			<aside>See more about links go to <a href="images.html">Links and Images</a>.</aside>


<h4>Paragraph</h4>
   			<p>The <code  >&lt;p&gt;</code> <code>&lt;/p&gt;</code>tags are probably the most frequently used tags you will see and use in a document, simply because it defines the portion of text that should be displayed as a paragraph. It is possible for a very simple page to be composed simply of <code>&lt;p&gt;</code><code> &lt;/p&gt;</code> elements, however, doing so is very limiting and would not tell you much about the information enclosed. Also, when we start to style the page using CSS, other structural tags, such as <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;article&gt;</code> help better define parts of the webpage for clearer and cleaner styling.</p>
    
    <h4>Footer</h4>
    		<p> The footer element workers in a similar way to the header element, only it comes at the end of a section or article. Using <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;/footer&gt;</code> tags, it supply additional information. It can be used multiple times on the same page, however, it is not necessary to include a footer for each or any section.</p>
    		
      <h3>Your Turn</h3>
   
   <p>Now that you have all of the elements you need to create the overall structure of the webpage, what will you include in yours?</p>
   <ul>
   <li>What are the major sections, or components of your webpage?</li>
   <li>What text do you want to include?</li>
   
   </ul>
