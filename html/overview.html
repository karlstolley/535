        <h2> Overview</h2>

        <p>The World Wide Web, aka the WWW , has undergone many changes since its inception a few decades ago.  HTML5 is the latest iteration of the primary markup language that makes webpages webpages. If you were indoctrinated into markup languages with another version of HTML or XHTML, have no fear, your knowledge is not obsolete.  Also, if you have only heard about HTMl in passing, don’t worry, this tutorial will walk you through the basics. </p>
    
        <p> Below are answers to questions you may have about HTML and HTML5.</p>
        <h5> If HTML5 is the lastest version, does that mean that HTML4 or XHTML do not work? </h5>
<p>Technically, yes, previous versions will work. This is the reason why why we still see remnants of the 1990's and its, shall we say, distinctly antiquated webpages emerge from the dark every now and then. If previous versions of HTML did not work, then we wouldn’t be able to see these pages. We can see previous versions of HTML because, unless the tags are deprecated, HTML5 enfolds all iterations within its specification. </p> 

<h5>What makes HTML5 different if old versions still work? Why should I learn HTML5 if I could use previous versions instead?</h5>
<p>HMTL5 has learned from previous versions and has taken the best of each while creating new features to keep up with the changes in technology and how people use the internet. It is both developer-friendly and viewer-friendly. However, since HTML5  is relatively new, some browsers may not support some of its features, though this is changing everyday; workarounds are available so this is generally not an issue. Needless to say, learning the latest version puts you ahead of the curve. Certain parts of the the language have been deprecated (are no longer in use) because better ways of handling them have emerged.</p> 
<p>The language that makes up HTML5 has not changed significantly over the years; it has only been refined to 1) integrate features that previously required added plug-ins and 2) make it easier for web designers to design. </p>

<!--A fuller explanation of browsers should move to it's own section
<p> Which brings us to the next point. How is that possible? It’s all made possible with this little thing we call browsers (yes, I know, web browsers). Some people never consider the how the information except by the question of whether or not they are connected (hello internet bills)  get to them, only that they do. All web browsers are free, so there is no cost to them except (in their experience). Most people don’t even bother or know they could use other browsers except for the ones that come with the software (Internet Explorer/Safari). But browsers.  Other browsers you  may have heard have.  </p>

<p>[Aside: Which browser are you using now? Test page.]</p>
 <p>If you look at the HTML for pages that were created 15 years, 15 months, or even 15 days ago, you will find a wide range of coding specifications running the gamut. Yet it all works. A related question is why can’t you see the code when you go to a page? The browser you are using renders/translates the code into an attractive (hopefully) combination of images and text. In short, code only works if the browser can understand it. That’s because the code is only as powerful as the browser The HTML tells the browser what to display. How this is displayed (how attractive) is determined by another type of code. Yes, there’s more. So much more. [For more on how to make the what attractive, go on to the CSS section, after this one of course].  Basically, HTML5 is interesting than previous versions, that it allows for all previous iterations to exist. Which is where HTML5 comes in. </p> --> 

<!-- Not only browsers but browser versions. As browsers update to newer versions to keep up with changing security risks and to offer additional features, there are parts of the HTML language that they stop using or start using. This also means that each version may not support some features of various languages, including HTML.</p> -->

<h5>So, what does HTML5 actually do?</h5>
      <p> HyperText Markup Language, or HTML, provides the infrastructure, that is to say,building blocks, for the content you want to display. It is not meant to create beautiful pages, only functional ones.</p>  
      <p>As we'll soon see, HTML tells the browser what each type of content is and how and in what order to display it on a webpage. In this sense, content is text, headers, navigation, images, links, audio, video, tables, forms, and lists. <p>

<h4>In short, with HTML you can:</h4>
<ul>
<li>create infrastructure for your content.</li>
<li>link to other websites or sections within the same website or webpage.</li>
<li>embed various types of "non-text" content in your webpage such as, images, video, audio, etc."</li>
<li>embed scripts which can effect the behavior of the content (i.e. make it do cool things).</li> 
<li>create interactive forms.</li>
</ul>

<h4> With HTML, you can't and/or shouldn't:</h4>
<ul>
<li> make content pretty.</li>
<li> make content do things. </li>
</ul>

<p>With HTML5 you can do the above faster and easier. In addition, HTML5 allows for better functionality across all types of browsers, including those for mobile devices.</p>

        <aside> There are a few exceptions (like HTML emails), however, they go beyond the scope of this guide. Suffice to say that 95% of the time, you will be using HTML for the reasons listed and not much beyond that.</aside>
