          <h2> Overview</h2>

        <p>The World Wide Web, aka the WWW , has undergone many changes since it’s inception a few decades ago.  HTML5 is the latest iteration of the primary markup language that makes webpages webpages. If you were indoctrinated into the web with another version of HTML,  or XHTML, have no fear, your knowledge is not considered obsolete.  If you have only heard about HTMl in passing, don’t worry, we’ll walk you through the basics. </p>
    
        <p> A few questions you may have at this point may be:</p>
        <h5> If HTML5 is the lastest version, does that mean that HTML4 or XHTML don't work? </h5>
<p>Technically, yes previous versions will work. Which is why we still see remnants of the nineties and its, shall we say, distinctly antiquated webpages emerge from the dark every now and then. If it didn’t work, then we couldn’t see it (unfortunately).</p>
<p>In all seriousness, we can see previous versions of html because, unless the tags are deprecated, HTML5 enfolds all iterations within its specification. 

<h5>What makes HTML5 different if old versions are allowed?</h5>
<p>HTML5 is relatively new, so some browsers may not support some of its features. Developers have been using workarounds since more than one browser appeared on the seen, so this is nothing new. HTML5 is expected to fully supported by all browsers by 2022. In the meantime, to see which HTML5 features are supported by which browsers, see here. (html5test).</p>

<!--A fuller explanation of browsers should move to it's own section
<p> Which brings us to the next point. How is that possible? It’s all made possible with this little thing we call browsers (yes, I know, web browsers). Some people never consider the how the information except by the question of whether or not they are connected (hello internet bills)  get to them, only that they do. All web browsers are free, so there is no cost to them except (in their experience). Most people don’t even bother or know they could use other browsers except for the ones that come with the software (Internet Explorer/Safari). But browsers.  Other browsers you  may have heard have.  </p>

<p>[Aside: Which browser are you using now? Test page.]</p>
 <p>If you look at the HTML for pages that were created 15 years, 15 months, or even 15 days ago, you will find a wide range of coding specifications running the gamut. Yet it all works. A related question is why can’t you see the code when you go to a page? The browser you are using renders/translates the code into an attractive (hopefully) combination of images and text. In short, code only works if the browser can understand it. That’s because the code is only as powerful as the browser The HTML tells the browser what to display. How this is displayed (how attractive) is determined by another type of code. Yes, there’s more. So much more. [For more on how to make the what attractive, go on to the CSS section, after this one of course].  Basically, HTML5 is interesting than previous versions, that it allows for all previous iterations to exist. Which is where HTML5 comes in. </p> --> 
<p>As you'll soon see, the language that makes up HTML5 has not changed significantly over over the year, it's only been refined to 1) integrate features that previously required added plug-ins into the webpage and 2) make it easier for web designers to design. </p>
<!-- Not only browsers but browser versions. As browsers update to newer versions to keep up with changing security risks and to offer additional features, there are parts of the HTML language that they stop using or start using. This also means that each version may not support some features of various languages, including HTML.</p> -->

<h5>So, what does HTML(5) actually do?</h5>
      <p> HyperText Markup Language, or HTML, provides the infrastructure, that is to say,building blocks, for the content you want to display... </p>

<p>In short, with HTML you can:
<ul>
<li>Create infrastructure for your content in various ways</li>
<li>Link to other websites or sections within the same website or webpage</li>
<li>Embed various types of "non-text" content in your webpage such as, images, audio, etc"</li>
<li>Create interactive forms</li>
<li>Embed scripts which can effect the behavior of the content (i.e. make it do cool things)</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p> What you can't and/or shouldn't do with HTML:
<ul>
<li> Make things pretty</li>
</ul>
