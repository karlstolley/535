<h2>Where Can I Learn More?</h2>

<p class="lead">A quick Google search would yield hundreds of tutuorials and references for learning more about HTML5 (and thousands for learning older versions of HTML, or HTML).  We've listed below are a few of the better resources.</p>

<h3>Behind the Scenes: Source Code</h3>
<p>Another way to learn more about HTML is to see it in action on the various websites that you visit. Look behind the scenes at the HTML source code to see how other webdesigners and webdevelopers put their websites together. Keep in mind that only the information that the browser renders will displayed, that is, only the information <em>not</em> processed by the server. Also, sometimes the source code may seem a little complicated with other languages and scripts being added to the mix, so stick with the simpler sites. Like this one! </p>

<h3>Your Turn</h3>
<p>Now that you see what's behind the veil, what tags can you pick out?</p>
<p>Why do you think we chose one tag over another if it looks like there could have been an option?</p>
<p>What would you do differently?</p>
