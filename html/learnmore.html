Another way to learn HTML is to see it in action on the various websites that you visit. Look behind the scenes at the source code for websites to see how other webdesigners and webdevelopers put it together. Sometimes the source code gets a little complicated with other languages and scripts being added to the mix, so stick with the simpler sites. Like this one! 
To view the source code on this webpage,
<li> if you are using Firefox,...</li>
<li> if you are using Chrome,...</li>
<li> if you are using Safari,...</li>
<li> if you are using Internet Explorer,...</li> 


<p>Now that you see what's behind the veil, what tags can you pick out?</p>
<p>Why do you think we chose one tag over another if it looks like there could have been an option?</p>
<p>What would you do differently?</p>
