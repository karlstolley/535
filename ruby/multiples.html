      <h4>Learning Goal</h4>
      <p>Add Arrays into Classes to loop through multiple courses.</p>

    </div>

<p>So far, we have been coding this a script that can only handle one course. Who only takes one course each semester? Yeah, this script needs to be changed. it needs to handle multiple courses to be of any use.</p>

<p>With the current script, we can handle one class. We also know, though, that it is possible to run through an Array or Hash quickly, since they are only lists whose values are identified by one variable and either a number (Array) or key (Hash). Since this will be an ordered list, an Array will probably do the job.</p>

<p>Now that we have the main work done inside of an Object, we should only need to change the code inside the Class. The Method calls to create the Object and its Methods should not need any revision.</p>

<h3>Changing the Ask Questions Method</h3>

<p>How would we change the first Method of CreateHTML?</p>

<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
  def ask_questions
    questions = {
      "What is the course number of your class?" =&gt; 'number',
      "What is the course title of your class?" =&gt; 'title',
      "Who teaches your class?" =&gt; 'instructor',
      "What day of the week does your class meet?" =&gt; 'day',
      "What time does class start?" =&gt; 'start_time',
      "What time does class end?" =&gt; 'end_time'
    }
    @courses_data = {}
    questions.each_pair { |question,answer|
      print "\n#{question} "
      @courses_data.merge!(answer =&gt; gets.chomp)
    }
  end
</pre>

<p>You will need to determine the number of courses taken by the user and then ask the existing questions of the user. Let's cut this into two problems to solve.</p>

<h4>Changing the Questions</h4>

<p>The questions would need to change so that it was clear about which course you were asking. So, some sort of numbering would help. That way, you would be asking not "What is the course title of your class?" but "What is the course title of class #1?"</p>

    <div class="bs-docs-example">
      <p>To add a number to each course question, without repeating yourself, you would to end each question with the word "class" and a space. This will let you tack on the number of the course and a question mark in your loop.</p>
    </div>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
    questions = {
      <span class="success">"What is the course number of class "</span> =&gt; 'number',
      <span class="success">"What is the course title of class "</span> =&gt; 'title',
      <span class="success">"Who teaches class "</span> =&gt; 'instructor',
      <span class="success">"What day of the week do you attend class "</span> =&gt; 'day',
      <span class="success">"When do you start class "</span> =&gt; 'start_time',
      <span class="success">"What do you leave class "</span> =&gt; 'end_time'
    }
</pre>

<h4>Changing the Loops</h4>

<p>We will probably need to first ask how many courses the user has in the current semester:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
    <span class="success">print "\nHow many classes do you have this semester? "</span>
    <span class="success">@course_count = gets.chomp</span>
    @courses_data = []
</pre>

<p>This gives us a number of courses identified by the Instance Variable <code>@course_count</code>. What does this Variable give you? It gives you the value for how long your loop should be. So, we would still have a <code>@courses_data</code> variable, that does not change. So what does change?</p>

<p>We need to make a counter for our loop. Could we not just use <code>@course_count</code>?</p>

    <div class="bs-docs-example">
      <p>No. The reason why has been covered before: computers count starting a zero. Unless you make sure that every single Array that will use this data starts at one, it is easier to change the number of course counter to a value that is one less than the number of courses (<code>@courses = (@course_count.to_i)-1</code>). OK, wait, did you see that extra Method <code>.to_i</code>? All responses from the command line are considered to be Strings. Well, Ruby cannot count using Strings, even if the String has a number as its value. So, <code>.to_i</code> tells Ruby to first convert <code>@course_count</code> to an Integer (or whole number) before subtracting one or setting <code>@courses</code> to that value. Read the sidebar "Everything is an Object" for more information.</p>

      <p>Now that you have a maximum number of courses that you will count toward, how do you start looping through the set of questions?</p>

    </div>

<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
    <span class="success">@courses = (@course_count.to_i)-1</span>
    <span class="success">0.upto(@courses) do |table_row|</span>
</pre>

<p>The loop is created with the <code>.upto</code> Method. It is taking the <code>@courses</code> value as its upper bound parameter, that is how far to count up to, starting from zero. The loop then uses <code>table_row</code> as an iteration variable. This loop will be known as the <strong>Outer Loop</strong>. Now, you need to collect the data for each course.</p>

<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
    @courses = (@course_count.to_i)-1
    0.upto(@courses) do |table_row|
      <span class="success">@courses_data[table_row] = {}</span>
      <span class="success">table_list_row = (table_row + 1).to_s</span>
      <span class="success">puts "\nFor Class #{table_list_row}\n"</span>
</pre>

<p>For each course, you will need to create a new Hash to store the answers and their variables, much like you did with the previous version of this Method. So, the first thing that happens with each pass of the <code>0.upto(@courses)</code> loop is creating a Hash to go into the current <code>table_row</code> of the <code>@courses_data</code> Array.</p>

<p>The next thing that you code is the course number that shows up in each question. The result would be that the user will see not <code>"What is the course number of class "</code> but <code>"What is the course number of class 1?"</code> Since the Outer Loop starts with zero, you will need to set the visible number to what ever the current pass through the loop is plus one. That value will then need to be converted to a String (using the <code>.to_s</code> Method) so it can be concatenated with the question String. Concatenation only works with String values.</p>

<p>The last thing you code in this part is a "header" for each course to let the user know for which course they are entering data. Then, you will code another loop that uses the same questions as the previous version of the Method with a small exception.</p>

<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
    @courses = (@course_count.to_i)-1
    0.upto(@courses) do |table_row|
      @courses_data[table_row] = {}
      table_list_row = (table_row + 1).to_s
      puts "\nFor Class #{table_list_row}\n"
      questions.each_pair { |question,answer|
        print "\n#{question} <span class="success">#{table_list_row}? "</span>
        @courses_data<span class="success">[table_row]</span>.merge!(answer =&gt; gets.chomp)
      }
</pre>

<p>The exception is that now the answer variable and user answer Hash are going into the Outer Loop Array. (Well, that and the question now shows the number to which course the user is responding.)</p>

<p>The last step for this Method will be to add one to the table_row iteration variable (or iterate) and end the Outer Loop.</p>

<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
    @courses = (@course_count.to_i)-1
    0.upto(@courses) do |table_row|
      @courses_data[table_row] = {}
      table_list_row = (table_row + 1).to_s
      puts "\nFor Class #{table_list_row}\n"
      questions.each_pair { |question,answer|
        print "\n#{question} #{table_list_row}? "
        @courses_data[table_row].merge!(answer =&gt; gets.chomp)
      }
      <span class="success">table_row += 1</span>
    end
</pre>

    <div class="bs-docs-example">
    <h4>Wait, What?</h4>
    <p>Yes, that was a lot of information. Let's break it down in detail:</p>
    </div>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
print "\nHow many classes do you have this semester? "

@course_count = gets.chomp
  # User answers "2", @course_count = 2

@courses_data = []
  # An empty Array called @courses_data is created

@courses = (@course_count.to_i)-1
  # The Outer Loop upper bound is set to (@course_count - 1) = 1

0.upto(@courses) do |table_row|
  # Starting with 0, loop until you reach 1.
  #   Use table_row as the Inner Loop iterator.
  #   Pass through the loop 2 times.

  @courses_data[table_row] = {}
    # Create the empty @courses_data[0] Hash

  table_list_row = (table_row + 1).to_s
    # Set the value for table_list_row to the Inner Loop
    # iterator + 1

  puts "\nFor Class #{table_list_row}\n"
    # Print a new line then for Class #1 then another new line

  questions.each_pair { |question,answer|
    # Loop through the questions Hash using question and answer
    #   for the key and value pairs in the Hash (Inner Loop)

    print "\n#{question} #{table_list_row}? "
      # Print a new line then the first question:
      #   What is the course number of  class 1?

    @courses_data[table_row].merge!(answer =&gt; gets.chomp)
      # Prompt the user for a response Store that value in
      #   @courses_data[1][number => "Answer"]

  }
    # Loop through the 5 questions / answer_pairs until all
    #   questions for Course 1 are answered
    # Five more passes
    # End the Inner Loop

  table_row += 1
    # Add 1 to table_row, so the loop continues with the 2nd pass
    # Another pass

end
  # End the Outer Loop
</pre>

<p>Now that you have collected the answers for each course, you need to display them.</p>

<p>This is a lot less to change. You will first add an Outer Loop for each course, as shown in Line 3 of this example. Then within each table row (<code>&lt;tr&gt;</code>), you will change the Inner Loop to use the iterator of the Outer Loop to loop through the table cells.</p>

<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
  def build_html_file
    puts "&lt;table&gt;"
    <span class="success">@courses_data.each do |table_row|</span>
      puts "  &lt;tr&gt;"
      <span class="success">table_row</span>.each_value { |table_cell| puts "    &lt;td&gt;#{table_cell}&lt;/td&gt;" }
      puts "  &lt;/tr&gt;"
    end
    puts "&lt;/table&gt;"
  end
</pre>

<p>As noted before, the Method to create a new Object and the methods of the new Object do not change from the previous version.</p>

<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
create_new_HTML = CreateHTML.new
create_new_HTML.ask_questions
create_new_HTML.build_html_file

<p>Now you are in the home stretch! Let's figure out how to write the HTML into a file rather than show it on the screen!</p>
