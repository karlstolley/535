    <h2>Create HTML Automatically</h2>
  </header>
  <section>

    <p>To have your Ruby script generate HTML is not as hard as you would think. You need to include the HTML tags in the Ruby code and concatenate them (<code>+</code>) to the data you were already creating.</p>

    <div class="bs-docs-example">
      <p>To add HTML to the output of a Ruby script, you would:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Add lines 21, 22, 29 and 30</li>
        <li>Add <code>"  &lt;td&gt;" + </code>&nbsp;between <code>puts</code> and each variable on lines 23-28</li>
        <li>Add&nbsp;<code> + "&lt;/td&gt;"</code> after each variable on lines 23-28</li>
      </ul>

    </div>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
#Version 1: Simple Script to HTML

print "What is the course number of your class? "
number = gets.chomp

print "What is the course title of your class? "
title = gets.chomp

print "Who teaches this class? "
instructor = gets.chomp

print "What is day of the week does class meet? "
day = gets.chomp

print "What time does class start? "
start_time = gets.chomp

print "What time does class end? "
end_time = gets.chomp

<span class="success">puts "&lt;table&gt;"</span>
<span class="success">puts "  &lt;tr&gt;"</span>
puts <span class="success">"    &lt;td&gt;" + </span>number<span class="success"> + "&lt;/td&gt;"</span>
puts <span class="success">"    &lt;td&gt;" + </span>title<span class="success"> + "&lt;/td&gt;"</span>
puts <span class="success">"    &lt;td&gt;" + </span>instructor<span class="success"> + "&lt;/td&gt;"</span>
puts <span class="success">"    &lt;td&gt;" + </span>day<span class="success"> + "&lt;/td&gt;"</span>
puts <span class="success">"    &lt;td&gt;" + </span>start_time<span class="success"> + "&lt;/td&gt;"</span>
puts <span class="success">"    &lt;td&gt;" + </span>end_time<span class="success"> + "&lt;/td&gt;"</span>
<span class="success">puts "  &lt;/tr&gt;"</span>
<span class="success">puts "&lt;/table&gt;"</span>
</pre>

    <p>Sound too easy? It is. All you needed to do was write the HTML tags in the Ruby script so when it created the results, they would have HTML in them. Nice, huh?</p>

    <p>You may have also noticed the changes to each question line (lines 3, 6, 9, 12, 15 and 18). They now use <code>print</code> instead of <code>puts</code>. Change your code to see what this will do.

    <p>Save your new Ruby script as <code>create_html1.rb</code>, then add it to your GitHub repository.</p>

    <p>Let's see what should display to the command line with the HTML formatting added.</p>
