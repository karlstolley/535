      <h4>Learning Goal</h4>
      <p>Understand core concepts of Ruby programming.</p>
    </div>

    <p>When we said what we have written so have is not "Ruby-like", we meant that it is unnecessarily long and repetitive.</p>

    <p>Ruby has two major principles about programming:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>There is always more than one way to do something.</li>
      <li>Don't Repeat Yourself.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The first may be somewhat obvious, otherwise there would not be a need or an advantage to having multiple programmers other than time. The second is more important, it can save you time coding and encourage you to keep your code cleaner, shorter and easier to read.</p>

    <p>What repeats in our last script? Well, most of it. We <code>print</code> multiple times. We <code>gets</code> multiple times. We <code>puts</code> multiple times. There has to be a way to isolate just our questions and variables. Then, we can loop through all of the questions and responses and loop through sending them to the screen when we're done.</p>

    <p>We can. It uses what Ruby (and other programming languages) call a <strong>Hash</strong>.</p>
