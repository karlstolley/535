      <p>IRB can also work with text, which it calls Strings. </p>

      <p>You can write a string in IRB by putting any text between single or double quotes (as long as the quotes match on either side). </p>

      Example

<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
irb(main):008:0&gt; "Hello Ruby!"
=&gt; "Hello Ruby!"
</pre>

      <p>It is also possible, using the + operator, to join two (or more) strings together.</p>

      Example

<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
irb(main):008:0&gt; "Hello " + "Ruby!"
=&gt; "Hello Ruby!"
</pre>

      <p>This addition is called concatenation. When you concatenate strings, you get the longer, complete string.</p>

      <p>Notice the space after the "Hello" in the last example? Without it, you would have seen:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
irb(main):008:0&gt; "Hello" + "Ruby!"
=&gt; "HelloRuby!"
</pre>

      <p>Spaces are important.</p>

      <p>In the last few examples, IRB displayed the strings for you. That's interesting enough. This "Hello Ruby!" is not a program, though. It is only a String. To turn it into a program, you need to tell Ruby explicitly to put something on the screen. That is done using a Method called, helpfully enough, <code>puts</code>.</p>

<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
irb(main):010:0&gt; puts "Hello Ruby!"
Hello Ruby!
=&gt; nil
</pre>

      <p>To recreate this as a small program, it would be necessary to place the puts function inside a method. You write a method by typing def [name of method] as the first line, then the lines needed to create the value you need, then the word end to indicate the end of that method.</p>

      Example

      <p>The method for "Hello Ruby!" could be written like this:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
irb(main):011:0&gt; def hello
irb(main):012:1>   puts "Hello Ruby!"
irb(main):013:1> end
=&gt; nil
</pre>

      <p>To run this method, type:

<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
irb(main):014:0&gt; hello
Hello Ruby!
=&gt; nil
</pre>

      <p>It displays <code>Hello Ruby!</code> (and returns <code>nil</code>) as expected.</p>

      <p>What if you want to say hello to someone else? Well, that's easy...</p>

  Expressions and Statements

        <dl>
          <dt>Method</dt>
          <dd>A series of expressions that return a value.</dd>

          <dt>Expression</dt>
          <dd>An expression represents a single piece of data. An expression consists of one or more operands (strings, numbers, variables) and usually an operator. Expressions are evaluated (or processed) to produce (or return) a result. Expressions are like math; one or more pieces of data called operands are compared or changed and return a result.

          <code>a + b</code> returns the value of a plus b
          <code>x = y</code> returns x which was set to the value of y
          <code>j++</code> returns j + 1
          <code>h < 0</code> compares h and 0 and says h is less than 0
          </dd>

          <dt>Statement</dt>
          <dd>
            <p>A statement causes the computer to carry out some definite action. Statements are like sentences; they tell the computer what state something is in (like an intransitive verb sentence, that something is something) or tell the computer to do something, like compare two values, do something a number of times or do something only if a condition is met.</p>

            <p>In summary, expressions have a value, while statements do not.</p>

            <p>In Ruby, there is no difference between expressions and statements. Everything in Ruby returns a value, even if it is nothing, which Ruby calls <code>nil</code>. As you saw earlier when using IRB, if the expression or method did not return a value, it displayed <code>=&gt; nil</code>.</p>

            <p>Ruby returns the last line evaluated in an expression or a method as its value.</p>

            <p>If we set the variable x to 6:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
irb(main):032:0&gt; x = 6
=&gt; 6
</pre>

            <p>It returns a value of 6, so the expression's value is 6.</p>

            <p>If we tell Ruby to put "Hello Ruby!" on the screen:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
irb(main):010:0&gt; puts "Hello Ruby!"
Hello Ruby!
=&gt; nil
</pre>

            <p>It returns <code>nil</code>. The expression did something; it displayed a string as it was told. The puts method does not return any value as it stores nothing and evaluates nothing. So, the only value is <code>nil</code>.</p>

            <p>Expressions are like the nouns in a sentence. Statements are the completed sentence or thought. One line in your method or loop could be an expression, and the conglomeration of those expressions into a closed loop or method could be thought of as a statement, which always returns a value.</p>
