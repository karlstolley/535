<h2>Why Program?</h2>
</header>
<section>

  <p>Most programming guides just jump into the language, but don't get into why someone would want to make their own program. With all of the commercial software available, why would anyone want to create their own?</p>

  <p>If you want to build a piece of furniture or repair a leaky faucet, you need the right tool. You wouldn't use a hammer when assembling a chair if all it came with were screws; you wouldn't try to tighten a pipe joint with a screwdriver. Even if you have a screwdriver or wrench, is it the proper screwdriver or the proper wrench? What if you could create the exact tool you needed when you needed it?</p>

  <p>We do. Programs are <b>tools</b>. They create or change <b>data</b>.</p>

  <p>Why program? So you can make the exact tool you need to work with your data. If you want to merge ten files into one, you can write a program to do it. If you want to change a comma-separated text file into an HTML table, you can write a program to do it.</p>

  <p>Let's get to it.</p>
