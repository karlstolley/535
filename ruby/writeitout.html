      <h4>Learning Goals</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>Error check a condition.</li>
        <li>Write results to a separate file instead of the screen.</li>
      </ol>
    </div>

<p>This script works pretty well, except for one problem. The user fills out their questionnaire and then has to try and copy and paste the result from the command line. That seems silly. There has to be a better way.</p>

<p>There is, and it only requires a change to the <code>build_html_file</code> script to do it.</p>

<p>Writing to a file in most programming languages involves opening a file then writing the content to that new file, then closing the file. Ruby is not much different, but it only needs to open and write to the file, nothing more.</p>

<p>To write to the file, you first need to provide a name for this file. You could hard code this into the script, or you could ask the user. We want to ask the user.</p>

<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
  <span class="success">html_filename = ""
  print "\n\nWhat do you want to call your Class listing file? "
  html_filename = gets.chomp + ".html"
  html_file = File.open(html_filename, "w")</span>
</pre>

<p>Line 1 creates a new variable with a blank String in it. Lines 2 and 3 just ask the user for the name of a file and then add the <code>.html</code> at the end. Line 4 is the magic. It assigns an open file called what the user specified (<code>html_filename + ".html"</code>) and allows it to be writable (<code>"w"</code>) using the <code>.open</code> Method of the <code>File</code> Class.
<code>html_file</code> is now an open file, ready to write new data.</p>

<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
  def build_html_file
    html_filename = ""
    print "\n\nWhat do you want to call your Class listing file? "
    html_filename = gets.chomp + ".html"
    html_file = File.open(html_filename, "w")
    <span class="success">html_file.</span>puts "&lt;table&gt;"
    @courses_data.each do |table_row|
      <span class="success">html_file.</span>puts "  &lt;tr&gt;"
      table_row.each_value { |table_cell| <span class="success">html_file.</span>puts "    &lt;td&gt;#{table_cell}&lt;/td&gt;" }
      <span class="success">html_file.</span>puts "  &lt;/tr&gt;"
    end
    <span class="success">html_file.</span>puts "&lt;/table&gt;"
    <span class="success">puts "\n" + html_filename + " created."</span>
  end
end
</pre>

<p>The difference is now that you <code>puts</code> the data to the file, not to the screen, by adding the file name variable (<code>html_file</code>) before each <code>puts</code>. To let the user know that something happened, we <code>puts</code> a line to the screen letting them know that the file was created.</p>

<h3>Checking for an Error</h3>

<p>Getting a name for the file from the user is great, but what if he or she just hits return. Would that be an error? How do we handle errors?</p>

<p>Ruby uses <code>rescue</code> to check for errors. A small block of code first attempts the desired method and, if it cannot do it, asks Ruby to <code>rescue</code> the script by running additional code to fix the problem rather than crash the script.</p>

<p>In this case, you would want to just open the new file. What if you didn't have a file name?</p>

<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
  def build_html_file
    html_filename = ""
    <span class="success">begin</span>
      html_file = File.open(html_filename, "w")
    <span class="success">rescue</span>
      print "\n\nWhat do you want to call your Class listing file? "
      html_filename = gets.chomp + ".html"
      <span class="success">retry</span>
    <span class="success">end</span>
    ...
end
</pre>

<p>The error catching block starts with the keyword <code>begin</code>. This tells Ruby that what follows is an error catching block. The block first tries to write the file with a filename it has. That filename is blank. This would normally cause Ruby to throw an error. The block does have a <code>rescue</code> section, so the script will then go to that. In this example, it asks the user for a filename. After it gets a filename, it retries the original task in the block (that is, it restarts from <code>begin</code>), and tries again. Now that it has a filename, it should work fine.</p>

<p>More complex error checking can be run at your discretion. This just gives you a feel for what could be done.</p>

<p>Where can you learn more?</p>
