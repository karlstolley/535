Ruby is a dynamic object-oriented programming language.

It can be used for just about any purpose: text processing, system utilities, Web development, even graphical applications.

Ruby was initially created by Yukihiro Matsumoto, aka “Matz,” and released to the public in 1995.

In 2005 and 2006, largely thanks to the popularity of the Ruby on Rails Web development framework (covered in Chapter 16, “Ruby on Rails”), Ruby came to the forefront of the worldwide computing consciousness.

Today, Ruby is one of the ten most-used programming languages, and its user base is predicted to quadruple by 2013.

Unlike C or C++ code, which is compiled into an executable application, Ruby code is most often run through an interpreter. The interpreter works on most operating systems, however, and the large majority of Ruby code is cross-platform compatible without modification.

Language

Interpreted

interpreted: program cannot be run without another program

Object-Oriented

object: unit of data that has attributes and methods; what it is, what it can do

Open Source

The code used to create the program is liberally licensed to grant users the right to use, copy, study, change, and improve its design through the availability of its source code.

Last but not least, Ruby is an open source project: it’s free for anyone to use, modify, or distribute. This also means that Ruby is maintained—and constantly being improved upon—by a broad spectrum of developers around the globe.

Ruby is a perfect Object Oriented Programming Language. The features of the object-oriented programming language include:

    Data Encapsulation:

In his book on object-oriented design, Grady Booch defined encapsulation as "the process of compartmentalizing the elements of an abstraction that constitute its structure and behavior; encapsulation serves to separate the contractual interface of an abstraction and its implementation."

Encapsulating software behind an interface allows the construction of objects that mimic the behavior and interactions of objects in the real world. For example, a simple digital alarm clock is a real-world object that a lay person can use and understand. They can understand what the alarm clock does, and how to use it through the provided interface (buttons and screen), without having to understand every part inside of the clock. Similarly, if you replaced the clock with a different model, the lay person could continue to use it in the same way, provided that the interface works the same.

    Data Abstraction:

The basic idea of data abstraction is to structure the programs that are to use compound data objects so that they operate on ``abstract data.'' That is, our programs should use data in such a way as to make no assumptions about the data that are not strictly necessary for performing the task at hand. At the same time, a ``concrete'' data representation is defined independent of the programs that use the data. The interface between these two parts of our system will be a set of procedures, called selectors and constructors, that implement the abstract data in terms of the concrete representation. To illustrate this technique, we will consider how to design a set of procedures for manipulating rational numbers.

    Polymorphism:

Referring to an object in many different ways (reference type is different from actual object class) is the point of polymorphism, which means "many forms". I can treat a Dog object like a Dog, or I can treat it like an Animal, or I can even treat it like a Pet, when I have the Dog class implement the Pet interface.

    Inheritance:

inheritance is a way to reuse code of existing objects, or to establish a subtype from an existing object, or both, depending upon programming language support. In classical inheritance where objects are defined by classes, classes can inherit attributes and behavior from pre-existing classes called base classes, superclasses, parent classes or ancestor classes. The resulting classes are known as derived classes, subclasses or child classes. The relationships of classes through inheritance gives rise to a hierarchy. In prototype-based programming, objects can be defined directly from other objects without the need to define any classes, in which case this feature is called differential inheritance.

These features have been discussed in Object Oriented Ruby.
