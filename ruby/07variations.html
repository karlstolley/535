        <p>If you want to say hello to someone else, you would need to provide Ruby (and IRB) with another name.</p>

        <p>That's not as hard as you would think.</p>

        <p>You would need to rewrite your short program to ask for the person's name when the method is called. This will require a placeholder that holds on to the name until it is displayed. This placeholder is called a <strong>variable</strong>.</p>

        Example

        <p>The method would be written like this:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
irb(main):015:0&gt; def hello name
irb(main):016:1>   puts "Hello " + name + "!"
irb(main):017:1> end
=&gt; nil
</pre>

        <p>When you call the method, you would type the name of the method and the person's name in quotes after it:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
irb(main):018:0&gt; hello "Tony"
Hello Tony!
=&gt; nil
</pre>

        <p>Not too difficult. What if you wanted to ask the person running this small program for their name and say hello?</p>

        <p>That will require you to ask for input, information from the user. Ruby uses the method <code>gets</code> to do this.</p>

        <p>Rewrite the hello method in IRB to ask for the person's name:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
irb(main):019:0&gt; def hello
irb(main):020:1>   puts "What is your name?"
irb(main):021:1>   name = gets
irb(main):022:1>   puts "Hello " + name + "!"
irb(main):023:1> end
=&gt; nil
</pre>

        <p>Now, when you call <code>hello</code>, you do not need to include the person's name. The program will ask the person for you.</p>

<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
irb(main):024:0&gt; hello
What is your name?
Tony
Hello Tony
!
=&gt; nil
irb(main):025:0&gt;
</pre>

        <p>Almost perfect. What's up with the line break between the person's name and the exclamation point?</p>

        <p>Well, the user put it there. When the user wrote their name, the last character they typed was the Return key. This creates a new line character (<code>\n</code>) that got tacked on the end of the name variable.</p>

        <p>How do you get rid of it?</p>

        <p>Chomp it.</p>

        <p>The method <code>chomp</code> allows you to strip away the new line character from the end of any string.</p>

        <p>You will need to rewrite the hello method again in IRB to see this. Give it a try:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
irb(main):025:0&gt; def hello
irb(main):026:1>  puts "What is your name?"
irb(main):027:1>  name = gets.chomp
irb(main):028:1>  puts "Hello " + name + "!"
irb(main):029:1> end
=&gt; nil
</pre>

        <p>Now, when you call hello, you see:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
irb(main):030:0&gt; hello
What is your name?
Tony
Hello Tony!
=&gt; nil
irb(main):031:0&gt;
</pre>

        <p>This rewriting of the same program over and over is getting a bit tiring. Next, we move to writing Ruby code in a file that we can edit when we want to make changes.</p>

        <p>Type <code>quit</code> in IRB to exit IRB.</p>
