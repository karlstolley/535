      <h4>Learning Goals</h4>
      <p>Change Ruby script to display HTML code as part of its results.</p>
    </div>

    <p>To have your Ruby script generate <a href="/html/" title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</a> is not as hard as you would think. You need to include the <a href="/html/" title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</a> tags in the Ruby code and concatenate them (<code>+</code>) to the data you were already creating.</p>

    <div class="bs-docs-example">
      <p>To add <a href="/html/" title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</a> to the output of a Ruby script, you would:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Add lines 21, 22, 29 and 30</li>
        <li>Add <code>"  &lt;td&gt;" + </code>&nbsp;between <code>puts</code> and each variable on lines 23-28</li>
        <li>Add&nbsp;<code> + "&lt;/td&gt;"</code> after each variable on lines 23-28</li>
      </ul>

    </div>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
#Version 1: Simple Script to HTML

print "What is the course number of your class? "
number = gets.chomp

print "What is the course title of your class? "
title = gets.chomp

print "Who teaches this class? "
instructor = gets.chomp

print "What is day of the week does class meet? "
day = gets.chomp

print "What time does class start? "
start_time = gets.chomp

print "What time does class end? "
end_time = gets.chomp

<span class="success">puts "&lt;table&gt;"</span>
<span class="success">puts "  &lt;tr&gt;"</span>
puts <span class="success">"    &lt;td&gt;" + </span>number<span class="success"> + "&lt;/td&gt;"</span>
puts <span class="success">"    &lt;td&gt;" + </span>title<span class="success"> + "&lt;/td&gt;"</span>
puts <span class="success">"    &lt;td&gt;" + </span>instructor<span class="success"> + "&lt;/td&gt;"</span>
puts <span class="success">"    &lt;td&gt;" + </span>day<span class="success"> + "&lt;/td&gt;"</span>
puts <span class="success">"    &lt;td&gt;" + </span>start_time<span class="success"> + "&lt;/td&gt;"</span>
puts <span class="success">"    &lt;td&gt;" + </span>end_time<span class="success"> + "&lt;/td&gt;"</span>
<span class="success">puts "  &lt;/tr&gt;"</span>
<span class="success">puts "&lt;/table&gt;"</span>
</pre>

    <p>Sound too easy? It is. All you needed to do was write the <a href="/html/" title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</a> tags in the Ruby script so when it created the results, they would have <a href="/html/" title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</a> in them. Nice, huh?</p>

    <p>You may have also noticed the changes to each question line (lines 3, 6, 9, 12, 15 and 18). They now use <code>print</code> instead of <code>puts</code>. Change your code to see what this will do.

    <p>Save your new Ruby script as <code>create_html1.rb</code>, then add it to your GitHub repository.</p>

    <p>Let's see what should display to the command line with the <a href="/html/" title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</a> formatting added.</p>
