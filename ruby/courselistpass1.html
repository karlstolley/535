      <p>Review created Ruby script.</p>
    </div>

    <p>The results of your first script should look something like this:</p>

<div class="bs-docs-example">
<p>Ruby script <code>create_html0.rb</code></p>

</div>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
#Version 0: Simple Script

print "What is the course number of your class? "
number = gets.chomp

print "What is the course title of your class? "
title = gets.chomp

print "Who teaches this class? "
instructor = gets.chomp

print "What is day of the week does class meet? "
day = gets.chomp

print "What time does class start? "
start_time = gets.chomp

print "What time does class end? "
end_time = gets.chomp

puts number
puts title
puts instructor
puts day
puts start_time
puts end_time
</pre>

    <p>Each question is displayed and a response is requested in order. When they are all done, they are printed to the screen.</p>

<div class="bs-docs-example">
<p>Command line results from running <code>create_html0.rb</code></p>

    <p>That did not result in <a href="/html/" title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</a> output, did it? No, that would require that the Ruby code in lines 21-26 in <code>create_html0.rb</code> included some <a title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</a> tags. For something that would most likely be in a table, we probably should change the output to use and HTML <code>&lt;TABLE&gt;</code>.</p>
