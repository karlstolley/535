Why Program?

Most programming guides just jump into the language, but don't get into why someone would want to make their own program. With all of the commercial software available, why would anyone want to create their own?

If you want to build a piece of furniture or repair a leaky faucet, you need the right tool. You wouldn't use a hammer when assembling a chair if all it came with were screws; you wouldn't try to tighten a pipe joint with a screwdriver. Even if you have a screwdriver or wrench, is it the proper screwdriver or the proper wrench? What if you could create the exact tool you needed when you needed it?

Well, at Technical Communication, we are not building chairs or fixing pipes; we are communicating information: we are working with data. Wouldn't it be great to have exactly the right tool to create new data or change data?

We do. Programs are tools. They create or change data.

Why program? So you can make the exact tool you need to work with your data. If you want to merge ten files into one, you can write a program to do it. If you want to change a comma-separated text file into an HTML table, you can write a program to do it.

Let's get to it.

Why Ruby?

There are many programming languages available to a new programmer. Some you may have heard--Java, C and Javascript, some you may not--Haskell, Lisp or SmallTalk.

Ruby is flexible, popular, easy to read and free.



Java

public class HelloWorld {
   public static void main(String[] args) {
       System.out.println("Hello world!");
   }
}

Ruby

puts "Hello world!"
