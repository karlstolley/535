        <p>At the very least, you can use Ruby as a high-powered calculator. If you were to open IRB and type:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
irb(main):001:0&gt; 2 + 2
</pre>

        <p>it would return</p>

<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
=&gt; 4
</pre>

        <p>Simple, right? Ruby can do more than add. Try to add and subtract two numbers.</p>

        <p>You probably saw something like this:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
irb(main):002:0&gt; 2 + 2
=&gt; 4
irb(main):003:0&gt; 2 - 2
=&gt; 0
</pre>

        <p>You can try to multiply and divide as well. This requires two characters that you may not have seen before: <code>*</code> for multiplication and <code>/</code> for division.</p>

        <p>These characters are known as <strong>operators</strong>.</p>

        <p>Try to multiple, then divide any two numbers.</p>

        <p>You probably saw something like this:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
irb(main):004:0&gt; 2 / 2
=&gt; 1
irb(main):005:0&gt; 2 * 2
=&gt; 4
</pre>

        <p>It is possible to square a number as well. This uses the <code>**</code> operator.</p>

Example

<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
irb(main):006:0&gt; 2 ** 3
=&gt; 8
irb(main):007:0&gt;
</pre>

        <p>The fancy calculator is all well and good, but what about text? What if you want to write programs that have words?</p>

          <dd>Operators compare, assign or change values of given data such as numbers or text. Ruby has 36 operators in its language: 6 arithmetic, 8 comparison, 7 assignment, 6 logical, 6 bitwise, 1 ternary and 2 range. Bitwise, ternary and range operators are not often used and are outside of the scope of this tutorial.</dd>
