    <h2>Why Ruby?</h2>
  </header>
  <section>
    <p>There are many programming languages available to a new programmer. Some you may know: Java, C and Javascript. Some you may not know: Haskell, Lisp or SmallTalk.</p>
    <p>Ruby is flexible, popular, easy to code and free.</p>

    <h3>Flexible</h3>
    <p>Ruby can be used for most anything: web applications, system utilities or even games. It is not made to only do one thing.</p>
    <p>Any programmer can also alter Ruby. If needed functionality does not exist in Ruby, the programmer can add it.</p>

    <h3>Popular</h3>
    <p>Ruby is one of the top ten most used programming languages. Ruby on Rails, introduced in 2003, allows for rapid development of web applications. Many well known sites use Rails: <a href="http://www.groupon.com">Groupon</a>, LinkedIn, GitHub, Hulu, Basecamp, Penny Arcade and others.</p>

    <p>Ruby's popularity stems from its ease of use and comprehension.</p>

    <h3>Easy to Read and Code</h3>

    <p>Ruby is written to appear as close to English as possible. It does not add more to the language to do something simple.</p>

    <p>If you want to have your computer show "Hello world!" on the screen, you would need to do the following...</p>

    <h4>In Java</h4>

<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
public class HelloWorld {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println("Hello world!");
  }
}
</pre>

    <p>Translated, this says: Create a block of code that anyone can use to show "Hello world!". In this block, there is a block of code, a function, that runs by default, called "main", whenever someone tries to use HelloWorld. This function does not require additional information. This function runs a command, called a method, that prints a line of text ("Hello world!") out to the system (System.out.println). <i>Whew.</i></p>

    <h4>In Ruby</h4>

<pre>
puts "Hello world!"
</pre>

    <p>This says put "Hello world!" on the screen.</p>

    <p>Which language would you rather learn?</p>

    <h3>Free</h3>

    <p>Ruby can be downloaded and installed at no cost. All you need to program with it is a text editor; no specialized programs are required.</p>
