    <h2>Instant Course List</h2>

  <p>Well, you wrote a Ruby script to give us an HTML-formatted course list. You also changed the script so it put the question and response on the same line. That's the difference between <code>print</code> and <code>puts</code>: <code>puts</code> always adds a new line character at the end of a line.</p>


<div class="bs-docs-example">
<p>Command line results from running <code>create_html1.rb</code></p>

</div>
<pre class="command-line linenums">
<span class="prompt">[~/Projects/ruby/scripts]</span><span class="prompt-end">$</span> ruby create_html0.rb
What is the course number of your class? com531
What is the course title of your class? Web Development
Who teaches this class? Karl Stolley
What is day of the week does class meet? Wednesday
What time does class start? 6:25pm
What time does class end? 9:05pm
&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;com531&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Web Development&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Karl Stolley&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;Wednesday&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;6:25pm&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;9:05pm&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
<span class="prompt">[~/Projects/ruby/scripts]</span><span class="prompt-end">$</span>
</pre>

<p>Looks like we're done, right? You wrote a script so a user could add their courses from the command line and get a formatted list they could include in their own web page.</p>

<p>Well, you wrote a script that let the user add <strong>one</strong> course. What about the rest of them? Also this does not seem to be a very Ruby-like way of programming. The script works, but lacks a certain elegance; we end up repeating ourselves unnecessarily.</p>

<p>Let's streamline this script first, then we can write a script that captures all courses, not just one.</p>
