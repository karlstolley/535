    <p>Now that you have a script that will create the course list you need, what if you want it to do more later?</p>

    <p>That may sound like we are getting ahead of ourselves, but think about it. Right now the script does two things:<p>
    <ol>
      <li>Asks questions</li>
      <li>Creates the HTML Table for your web page</li>
    </ol>
    <p>This functionality is in one script. There's no way to reuse part of it, like the create <a href="/html/" title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</a> <code>table</code> part, from another program later. Well, maybe you would not reuse parts of this script, but you should get in the habit of writing <em>modular</em> code: code that has smaller reusable methods that can be reused. That way, you can build off of your previous work.</p>

    <p>Sounds nice, right? Well, how would you do that?</p>

    <p>You would use Methods. You have been using Methods for a large part of this chapter: <code>.each</code>, <code>.chomp</code>, <code>puts</code>, <code>gets</code>, and others. Where do <em>those</em> Methods come from?</p>

    <p>This is where the discussion gets interesting. Ruby is called an Object Oriented Programming Language.</p>

    <p>Big words. Simple concept. What can be done in a Ruby program is done by <strong>Objects</strong>. Objects are parts of a program that have certain properties and can do certain tasks. These properties and tasks (Methods) are unique to that Object. This groups code so you can use an Object to accomplish certain tasks because you will know exactly how that Object would behave.</p>

    <p>Wait, if each Object can have its own properties and methods, how can we know those properties and methods?</p>

    <p>Objects are not entirely unique. They are built from a blueprint called a <strong>Class</strong>. OK, let's dive into that concept for a minute:</p>

    <p>If you want to build a house, you need a blueprint. This blueprint will tell you that a house has electricity, water, gas, doors, windows and floors. These are common properties of houses. This blueprint will also tell you that a house can get water, get electricity and get gas.</p>

    <p>What you do when you program is that you create an Object from a Class. Creating a new instance (copy) of an Object is called <strong>instantiation</strong>.</p>

    <p>To follow the analogy, if we instantiate a House Object, we would say how many floors, doors and windows it has. Houses have basic requirements, but a specific House can have any allowed quantity of doors, windows, etc. because that House is unique.</p>

    <div class="bs-docs-example">
      To create a Class in Ruby, you only need to use the keyword <code>class</code> followed by the name of the Class beginning with a capital letter. This is important to Ruby; it's how it distinguishes between Objects and methods or variables.
    </div>

<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
class House

end
</pre>

    <p>The Class is simple. Too simple. We should create a Class with some properties and methods.</p>

<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
class House doors
  number_of_doors = doors
  def open_door
    puts "door is open"
  end
end
</pre>

    <p>That's better. Now, to instantiate an Object, all you need to do is call it:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
my_house = House.new(1)
</pre>

    <p>The new House Object <code>my_house</code> now has a property (<code>number_of_doors</code>, set to <code>1</code>) and a method (<code>.open_door</code>). This would let us write code that would access those capabilities.</p>

<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
my_house.open_door
doors = my_house.number_of_doors
</pre>

    <p>Your script needs to have either the Class and the call to it in the same script or use an <code>include</code> to tell your script which file has the Class file.</p>

    <p>Enough theory. Let's get to it.</p>

          <dd>Blueprint code from which copies of itself can be created with predictable properties and capabilities.</dd>
          <dt>Object</dt>
          <dd>Groups of code in program that have certain properties and can do certain tasks. Objects are instances of a Class.</dd>
