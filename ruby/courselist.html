    <h2>Down to Business: Making a Course List</h2>
  </header>
  <section>

    <p>Let's actually make something. In creating a web site about you, why not include a list of the courses that you're taking at IIT?</p>

    <p>Let's start with just one class so we can make sure we understand the basics.</p>

    <p>You will need to include 6 things about the class:</p>

    <ul>
    <li>Course Number</li>
    <li>Course Title</li>
    <li>Instructor</li>
    <li>Day(s) of the Week that it meets</li>
    <li>Class start time</li>
    <li>Class end time</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This would be best done through a series of questions.</p>

    <h3>Exercise</h3>

    <p>Write six questions that collect this information then display it on the screen.</p>

    Each question should be put on the screen, get the user's response (without the trailing new line!) and put the response on the screen once they have all been answered.

    Save this script as <code>create_html0.rb</code>.

    Add this script to your git repo, commit it and upload it to your GitHub account.

    <p>When you have completed this exercise, we can see how to make it output <a href="/html/" title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</a>.</p>
