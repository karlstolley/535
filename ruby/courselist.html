      <h4>Learning Goals</h4>
      <p>Write a complete Ruby script.</p>
    </div>

    <p>Let's actually make something. In creating a web site about you, why not include a list of the courses that you're taking at IIT?</p>

    <p>Let's start with just one class so we can make sure we understand the basics.</p>

    <p>You will need to include 6 things about the class:</p>

    <ul>
    <li>Course Number</li>
    <li>Course Title</li>
    <li>Instructor</li>
    <li>Day(s) of the Week that it meets</li>
    <li>Class start time</li>
    <li>Class end time</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This would be best done through a series of questions.</p>

    <h3>Exercise</h3>

    <p>Write six questions that collect this information then display it on the screen.</p>

    <p>Each question should be put on the screen, get the user's response (without the trailing new line!) and put the response on the screen once they have all been answered.</p>

    <p>Save this script as <code>create_html0.rb</code>.</p>

    <p>Add this script to your git repo, commit it and upload it to your GitHub account.</p>

    <p>When you have completed this exercise, we can see how to make it output <a href="/html/" title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</a>.</p>
