      <p class="lead">Sass is awesome. That is all.</p>

      <p>This section will not include specific learning objectives or a Test Your Knowledge section. To install Sass requires (if you're using
        a Windows machine) a significant addition to your operating system--Ruby. The <a href="/ruby">Ruby</a> chapter of this site allows you to
      get some practice from the command line, but Sass requires a full installation.</p>
      <p>You'll learn more about Sass in other courses, but here you can get an introduction to what it is, why it's awesome, and where to go if
      you want to install it and try it yourself.</p>

      <h2>What is Sass?</h2>
      <p>Sass stands for <strong>Syntactically Awesome Stylesheets</strong>. It is an extension of <a href="/css/css3.html">CSS3</a> that acts as
        a metalanguage and allows you to write your CSS rules using the logic and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) philosophy of programming. If you view the
      CSS source code from most websites, you'll find a long, ugly page of style rules with very little logic. Using Sass allows you to include
      programming elements such as variables and nesting in your style rules.</p>

      <h3>Sass is CSS</h3>
      <p>It's important to note that Sass is metalanguage, meaning that it is language to describe the CSS language. It generates standard CSS rules. This
      makes sense: browsers understand CSS rules, not Sass rules. Sass syntax is written in in a text editor or other programming platform and it later translated
      into a CSS file (or files) that browsers can read. If you compared a CSS file that was written by hand to one that was generated by Sass, they would appear identical.
      Let's go under the covers and see how where the power of Sass comes into play.</p>

      <h3>Sass is Not CSS</h3>
      <p>But only in that it is stored in its own file, an <strong>.scss</strong> file. This is used by the program
        to generate a standard <strong>.css</strong> file that can be read by web browsers.</p>

      <aside>The initial version of Sass used a <strong>.sass</strong> file based on <a href="http://haml.info/">HAML</a>,
        but .scss is the newer version that <em>extends</em> CSS rather than simply making it more concise.</aside>
