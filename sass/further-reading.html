      <p class="lead">Want to try out Sass for yourself? Follow these steps:</p>


      <ol>
        <li>
          Install Ruby on your computer. Ruby has several different versions available, but if you only need it to
          use Sass, then just select the most recent stable version.
          <ul>
            <li>Have a Mac running OSX? Good news: you already have it. Skip to the next step.</li>
            <li>Have Windows? Use the <a href="http://railsinstaller.org/">RailsInstaller</a>.</li>
            <li>Have Linux? You probably already know what you're doing, but here's <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/">some information</a>.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Install the Sass code package (called a "gem").
<pre>
gem install sass
</pre>
        </li>
        <li>
          Technically, you could start using Sass after this step, but since you've already taken the time to
          install/configure Ruby, you should also install the Compass gem. Compass is a way to automate the conversion of .scss files
           to .css files. It's definitely worth the extra step.
<pre>
gem install compass
</pre
        </li>
        <li>Create a test Compass project
          <ol>
            <li>Open the command line tool and navigate to the location where you want your new project created.</li>
            <li>Type <code>compass create test-project1</code>.</li>
            <li>Navigate to the <code>test-project1</code> directory that was generated by the Compass gem.</li>
            <li>From the same location as above, run the Compass command that will watch for changes to your .scss scripts and
            automatically convert them into.css files:
<pre>
compass watch test-project1
</pre>
            This will tell the Compass gem to watch for any changes to the .scss files and convert them to .css files.</li>
            <li>Open the <code>test-project1/sass/screen.scss</code> file in your favorite editing program.</li>
            <li>Start writing your Sass rules and watch the files in the <code>stylesheets</code> directly get updated each time you save the file.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>

        <li>
          If you already have a project in place, you can either change your configuration to match the standard Compass/Sass structure, or
          use the <a href="http://compass-style.org/install/">Compass Project tool</a> to change the standard configuration settings.
        </li>
      </ol>
