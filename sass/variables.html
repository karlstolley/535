      <p class="lead">This is usually where people get hooked on Sass: the ability assign variables to items. </p>

      <h2>Using Variables for Colors</h2>
      <p>My favorite place to use Sass variables is when declaring colors in Hex or RGB mode: it's difficult to remember what #4C1BE0 means
        when you look through your CSS rules, and if you haven't been good about using comments, then you have to look it up manually.</p>

      <h3>Variable Hex Colors</h3>
      <p>Here is an example of using variables for color in Sass. This is what the normal CSS that is generated by Sass would look like:</p>
<pre>
body {
  background: #89a194;
  padding: 20px 10px 10px 10px;
  color: #322938;
}
body a {
  color: #a14016;
  font-weight: 900;
}
</pre>

      <p>And here's how the Sass language makes that much more readable:</p>
<pre>
<span class="exampleAside">$green</span>: #89A194;
<span class="exampleAside">$grey</span>: #322938;
<span class="exampleAside">$orange</span>: #A14016;

body {
  background: <span class="exampleAside">$green;</span>
  padding: 20px 10px 10px 10px;
  color: <span class="exampleAside">$grey;</span>
}
body a {
  color: <span class="exampleAside">$orange;</span>
  font-weight: 900;
}
</pre>

      <p>By assigning the Hex code to a variable, you can keep track of the colors you're using in your CSS rules without having to load the page
      into a browser.</p>
