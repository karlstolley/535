      <p class="lead">Nesting code keeps your CSS from becoming tangled and unmanageable: you know, spaghetti-like.</p>

      <h2>Logical Groupings</h2>

      <p>When you start working on larger projects, you'll begin to see just how large your CSS file can get. You generally start
      out writing CSS code with the plan to structure your elements in the most logical way: first headers and footers, then
      main page elements, then individual page details later. As deadlines approach (or are shortened!), the urge to make quick
      changes at the bottom of the file becomes more appealing. Then weeks or months later when you have to make updates, you find yourself
      struggling through the CSS logic trying to find the section you need to change. </p>

      <p>A large project can include multiple CSS files with hundreds of lines of code. <strong>Nesting</strong> within
      Sass allows you to keep your code orderly.</p>

      <p>A typical example is how basic HTML5 elements can change in a page's footer section. Since "footer" is an
        <a href="/html/structure.html">HTML5 tag</a>, we can nest all of our footer-specific elements under that tag in the
      Sass file:</p>
<pre>
/* Footer code block. All footer elements go here */
<span class="exampleAside">footer</span> {
  p { /* This block is for all paragraph tags within the footer element. */
    width: 40%;
    display:inline;

    a { /* This block is for any anchor tags within paragraph tags in the footer element. */
      font-weight: 900;
    }
  }

  p.copyright { /* A special class of paragraph within the footer. */
    width: 40%;
    display:inline;
    float:right;
    text-align:right;
  }

<span class="exampleAside">}</span> /* End of the footer nested block. */
</pre>
      <p>But since Sass is really CSS, it will get compiled (manually, or automatically using a Ruby library 
        called <a href="http://compass-style.org/">Compass</a>) as standard CSS. CSS doesn't use nested code, so individual
      rules need to be made for your nested code. Here is what the compiled CSS file will look like:</p>

<pre>
footer p {
  width: 40%;
display: inline;
}

footer p a {
  font-weight: 900;
}

footer p.copyright {
  width: 40%;
  display: inline;
  float: right;
  text-align: right;
}
</pre>
      <p>Since you will work within the Sass <strong>.scss</strong> file, you are still following the DRY principle of development, and
      the CSS rules are all grouped together for anyone who may only have your <strong>.css</strong> file to use as a reference.</p>
