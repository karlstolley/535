      <p class="lead">Mixins are bits of code written by you (or someone else) to avoid re-creating the CSS wheel.</p>
      
      <p>Mixins are like any other <em>software function</em>: a set of instructions that can be acted upon by the software being run--in this case, the
      Sass program. As with other programming functions, they need to be defined before they can be used.</p>

      <h2>Defining a Mixin</h2>
      <p>To define a mixin, simply give it a name and wrap the CSS/Sass rules with within the <code>@mixin</code> tag:</p>
<pre>
  @mixin my-custom-css-code {
    
  }
</pre>
      <p>What goes in between the braces is any valid CSS or Sass code. Say you have a site that
        uses many different kinds of tables to hold data. You need to have a consistent look for some tables, but others will look different.
        You can create a mixin that will apply custom CSS rules to the tables you specify. Here's what that mixin code might look like:</p>
      
<pre>
  $tableFont: 'Michroma', Verdana, Arial,  sans-serif;
  $tableFontColor: #CCCCCC;
  $tableDataSize: 12px;
  $tableHeaderSize: 16px;

  @mixin format-data-table {
    font-family: $tableFont;
    color: $tableFontColor;
    th {
      font-size: $tableHeaderSize;
      padding: 4px 2px;
      text-align: center;
    }
    td {
      font-size: $tableDataSize;
    }
  }
</pre>
     <h2>Using a Mixin</h2>
     <p>When you need to use the mixin, simply call it by name with the <code>@mixin</code> tag:</p>

<pre>
  /* Budget report #1 section */

  #intro {
    th, td { /* different table style rules */
      font-size: 10px;
      font-color:blue;
    }
  }
  /* budget report page */
  #rpt1 {
    h1, h2, h3 { /* re*/
      font-color: red;
      font-weight:strong;
    }
    @include format-data-table; /* use standard data table formatting for all budget reports*/
  }
</pre>

     <p>Mixins are another Sass method of the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) code philosophy.</p>
