      <h2>Learning Objectives</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Describe what a CSS selector does</li>
        <li>Describe what a CSS declaration does</li>
        <li>Use CSS rules to position HTML elements on a page</li>
        <li>Apply CSS rules to classes and IDs</li>
        <li>Load CSS from an external stylesheet</li>

        <a href="/css/examples/page-with-CSS.html" class="btn btn-large">Fabulous CSS-Styled HTML Page</a>
      <p>Pretty fancy, huh? Let's get started by talking about <a href="selectors.html">selectors</a>. They're the first part of the CSS equation.</p
