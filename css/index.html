      CSS is where you can turn your plain black-text-on-a-white-background HTML pages into the picture that you have in your head. If HTML is the cake, then CSS is the frosting.
      </p>

      <h2>Learning Objectives</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Describe what a CSS selector does</li>
        <li>Describe what a CSS declaration does</li>
        <li>Use CSS rules to position HTML elements on a page</li>
        <li>Apply CSS rules to classes and IDs</li>
        <li>Load CSS from an external stylesheet</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Definition</h2>
      <p>CSS stands for "Cascading Style Sheets." It's the language you use to tell a machine how to display your data. For our purposes, we'll use CSS to tell a web browser how to display our <a href="#" class="checkThisLater">(HTML document ?name of project)</a>. </p>
      
      <h2>Browsers</h2>

        <a href="/css/examples/page-no-CSS.html" class="btn btn-large">Plain Old Boring HTML Page</a>
        <a href="/css/examples/page-with-CSS.html" class="btn btn-large">Fabulous CSS-Styled HTML Page</a>
      <p>Pretty fancy, huh? Let's get started by talking about <a href="selectors.html" class="btn">selectors</a>. They're the first part of the CSS equation.</p
