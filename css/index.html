      CSS is where you can turn your plain black-text-on-a-white-background HTML pages into the picture that you have in your head. If HTML is the cake, then CSS is the frosting.
      </p>

      <h2>By the End of This Section You Should Be Able To...</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Describe what a CSS selector does</li>
        <li>Describe what a CSS declaration does</li>
        <li>Apply basic CSS styles to an HTML page</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>The Beginning:</h3>
      <p>CSS stands for "Cascading Style Sheets." It's the language you use to tell a machine how to display your data. For our purposes, we'll use CSS to tell a web browser how to display our <a href="#" class="checkThisLater">(HTML document ?name of project)</a>. </p>

      <p>Need convincing? Here are some examples.</p>
        <a href="/css/examples/page-no-CSS.html" class="btn btn-large">Plain Old Boring HTML Page</a>
        <a href="/css/examples/page-with-CSS.html" class="btn btn-large">Fabulous CSS-Styled HTML Page</a>
      <p>Pretty fancy, huh? Let's get started by talking about <a href="selectors.html" class="btn">selectors</a>. They're the first part of the CSS equation.</p>
