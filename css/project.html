        Use CSS to add style to <span class="checkThisLater">Your Project</span>.
      </p>

      <h2>1. Choose TWO themes for your page</h2>
      <p>Use your new <a href="/js">JavaScript</a> chops to switch back and forth between two different CSS themes. Here are some ideas for the two themes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A light theme and a dark theme</li>
        <li>A brightly-colored theme and a muted color theme.</li>
        <li>A theme that positions text blocks on the left side of the screen and one on the right.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Remember you can anything in your theme: fonts, backgrounds, anything.</p>
      <p>If you're like me, you might feel overwhelmed by having to choose a color palette. Here are some sites I use often:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><h3><a href="http://www.colourlovers.com/">COLOURlovers.com</a></h3>
          <p>My favorite library. It gives you color palettes in RGB and Hex codes, and there's
          also a pattern library in case you want to use background images. You can search by keyword or sort by different parameters.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3><a href="https://kuler.adobe.com/">Kuler</a></h3>
          <p>This is an Adobe design site. You can search for colors or upload a favorite image and select colors from that.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3><a href="http://www.patternhead.com/">Pattern Head</a></h3>
          <p>Many free vector pattern images for download. Vector images can be re-colored and resized without
          losing image quality. </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>2. Decide Element Positioning</h2>
      <p>You should probably keep things pretty basic while you're still learning CSS, but here are some ideas you might want to try:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Indenting your main text slightly so that your heading tags will be more prominent.</li>
        <li>Floating your <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> name header to the left and your contact information to the right, as many resumes do.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>3. Create Your Stylesheets</h2>
      <p>Use the instructions in the <a href="/css/stylesheets.html">Stylesheet</a> section to write your rules. It will be much easier for you to make
      changes later on when your rules are in a separate document.</p>

      <h3>Testing</h3>
      <p>To switch between two different themes on one page, it's easiest to use different <a class="checkThisLater" href="/css/classes-and-ids-as-selectors.html">classes</a>.
          You can create your initial page with every element you want to style have one class assigned to it, 
          such as <code>&lt;p class=&quot;light&quot;&gt;</code>. 
      </p>
      <p>You can always look at your changes in the browser, but browsers can also give you additional tools to make debugging your CSS code easier.</p>
      <h4>Chrome</h4>
      <p>The <a href="http://www.google.com/chrome">Chrome browser</a> has some web developer tools built directly into it's structure. If you right-click on any HTML element,
      you can select the "Inspect Element" option to look at the structure of any web page. It will show you all of the document's elements, what CSS rules 
      have been applied, and which stylesheet(s) they came from. I use this tool almost every day.</p>
      <h4>FireFox</h4>
      <p>The <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/">FireFox browser</a> has an entire library of add-ons that can be installed in the browser. These are
      utilities written by programmers for public use. <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/45/">Chris Pederick</a> has created one of the
      most popular: Web Developer. There are many tools included, but one will allow you to edit the CSS of a website directly within the browser. These are only
      temporary changes (you must save any changes into your site's stylesheet), but it is very helpful when you need to make tweaks to your CSS code and want to
      see results right away.</p>

      <h2>4. Create a JavaScript Button</h2>
      <p>Add a button (or link) to your page that says something like "Click to change page theme," or something similar. Your JavaScript code will then look
      for each instance of your initial class name--"light" in the above example--and change it to your second class name. After the button is clicked, your styled elements
      should now have your second class name applied to them, e.g. <code>&lt;p class=&quot;dark&quot;&gt;</code>. Happy coding!</p>
