      <p class="lead">If you have completed the CSS chapter, you should now be familiar with the following topics:</p>

      <h2>CSS Selectors</h2>

        <p>Selectors are the syntax that allow you to identify which HTML5 objects you want to target for your CSS rules and apply declarations that will
        change the look and feel of your page.</p>
        <p>Return to the <a href="selectors.html">Selectors</a> section.</p>

      <h2>CSS Declarations</h2>
        <p>Declarations are applied to CSS selectors within a web page. They consist of two parts: a property and a corresponding value.</p>
        <p>Return to the <a href="declarations.html">Declarations</a> section.</p>
    
      <h2>Using CSS Rules for Positioning</h2>
      <p>Positioning refers to creating CSS rules to places elements in a particular area on the page, regardless of where in the document it is references.</p>
        <p>Return to the <a href="positioning.html">Positioning</a> section.</p>

      <h2>Using Classes and Ids in CSS Rules</h2>
        <p>Classes and IDs are applied to HTML5 elements to distinguish them from similar elements. When you want to apply the same style rules to a specific set of elements, add a class name to those elements.
        If you want to apply style rules to only one element, refer to it by a unique ID name.</p>
        <p>Return to the <a href="classes-and-ids-as-selectors.html">Classes and IDs as Selectors</a> section.</p>


      <h2>Storing CSS Rules in an External Stylesheet</h2>
        <p>Maintaining your style rules is much easier if you store them in external stylesheets. This keeps you from having to find the specific HTML file that you have have put the rule in and lets
        you make changes much more quickly.</p>
        <p>Return to the <a href="stylesheets.html">Stylesheets</a> section.</p>
