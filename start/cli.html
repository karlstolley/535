          The first time you see it, the command-line interface (or more simply, the command line)
          seems like a throwback to a primitive era of computing.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is.
        </p>
        <p>
          But despite its appearance, the command line is a powerful means of interacting with
          a computer. And in certain cases, there are things that a command line can do that
          you simply can't do from within a fancy, contemporary graphical user interface (GUI)
        </p>
        <h1>Where am I?</h1>
        <p>
          The command line always opens putting you *somewhere* in the computer's file system. Most
          often this is in your home directory. On a Linux-like system, running the <code>pwd</code>
          command will output something like this:
        </p>
<pre>
$ pwd
/home/username
$
</pre>
        <p>
          Where <code>username</code> is actually your user name on the system, something like
          <code>janesmith</code> for Jane Smith.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, despite how boring that example is, it illustrates the command-line interface in
          action (and how it is often represented in instructional contexts and books). You have
          a command prompt, usually represented as <code>$</code> (which you do <b>not</b> type),
          and you type a command (like <code>pwd</code>, or "print working directory") followed by
          the <kbd class="btn btn-mini">Return</kbd> or <kbd class="btn btn-mini">Enter</kbd> key.
          With many commands, the command line then offers some kind of output,
          <code>/home/janesmith</code>, followed by a new prompt, <code>$</code>, ready to accept
          another command. (However, oftentimes, the new prompt is not shown, as will be the style
          here.
        </p>
        <h1>What's here?</h1>
        <p>
          Once you've figured out where you are in the computer's file system, you can ask for a
          list of the directory's contents with the list command, <code>ls</code>. Running
          <code>ls</code> on Mac OS X in your home directory will output something like:
<pre >
$ ls
Desktop  Documents  Downloads  Library  Movies  Music  Pictures  Public
</pre>
        <p>
          That's the listing of default directories for an OS X user account. If we wanted more
          details about the directory's contents, we can pass a flag, <code>-l</code>, to
          the <code>ls</code> command:
        </p>
<pre >
$ ls -l
drwx------+  5 username  staff   170 Sep  4 14:42 Desktop
drwx------+  4 username  staff   136 Apr 23 22:19 Documents
drwx------+  4 username  staff   136 Apr 23 22:19 Downloads
drwx------+ 34 username  staff  1156 Sep  4 14:41 Library
drwx------+  3 username  staff   102 Apr 23 22:19 Movies
drwx------+  3 username  staff   102 Apr 23 22:19 Music
drwx------+  4 username  staff   136 Apr 23 22:19 Pictures
drwxr-xr-x+  5 username  staff   170 Apr 23 22:19 Public
</pre>
        <p>
          (We will learn about what all that means in the section on <a href="file-permissions.html">file permissions</a>.)
        </p>
        <p>
          Sometimes, rather than passing a flag, like <code>-l</code>, we pass an argument. To move,
          for example, from the working directory above into the <code>Documents</code> directory,
          we'd use the change directory command, <code>cd</code>, and give it <code>Documents</code>
          as an argument:
        </p>
<pre>
$ cd Documents
$ pwd
/Users/username/Documents
</pre>
        <p>
          What happens if you run <code>cd</code> by itself, with no arguments? Try it, and then
          run <code>pwd</code> again.
        </p>
        <h1>What Else?</h1>
        <p>
          The three commands we've looked at so far have told us our working directory, and the
          contents of the directory, as well as how to change directories.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here are some other interesting commands to try; see if you can guess their purpose, based
          on their output:
        </p>
<pre>
$ uptime
15:17  up 22:31, 3 users, load averages: 0.41 0.35 0.33
$ who
username  console  Oct 15 16:46
username  ttys000  Oct 16 12:32
username  ttys001  Oct 16 14:31
$ date

$ which date
